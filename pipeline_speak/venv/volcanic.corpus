Volcanoes are Earth's geologic architects. They've created more than 80 percent of our planet's surface, laying the foundation that has allowed life to thrive. Their explosive force crafts mountains as well as craters. Lava rivers spread into bleak landscapes. But as time ticks by, the elements break down these volcanic rocks, liberating nutrients from their stony prisons and creating remarkably fertile soils that have allowed civilizations to flourish. There are volcanoes on every continent, even Antarctica. Some 1,500 volcanoes are still considered potentially active around the world today; 161 of those over 10 percent sit within the boundaries of the United States. But each volcano is different. Some burst to life in explosive eruptions, like the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, and others burp rivers of lava in what's known as an effusive eruption, like the 2018 activity of Hawaii's Kilauea volcano. These differences are all thanks to the chemistry driving the molten activity. Effusive eruptions are more common when the magma is less viscous, or runny, which allows gas to escape and the magma to flow down the volcano's slopes. Explosive eruptions, however, happen when viscous molten rock traps the gasses, building pressure until it violently breaks free. The majority of volcanoes in the world form along the boundaries of Earth's tectonic plates massive expanses of our planet's lithosphere that continually shift, bumping into one another. When tectonic plates collide, one often plunges deep below the other in what's known as a subduction zone. As the descending landmass sinks deep into the Earth, temperatures and pressures climb, releasing water from the rocks. The water slightly reduces the melting point of the overlying rock, forming magma that can work its way to the surface the spark of life to reawaken a slumbering volcano. Not all volcanoes are related to subduction, however. Another way volcanoes can form is what's known as hotspot volcanism. In this situation, a zone of magmatic activity or a hotspot in the middle of a tectonic plate can push up through the crust to form a volcano. Although the hotspot itself is thought to be largely stationary, the tectonic plates continue their slow march, building a line of volcanoes or islands on the surface. This mechanism is thought to be behind the Hawaii volcanic chain. Where are all these volcanoes? Some 75 percent of the world's active volcanoes are positioned around the ring of fire, a 25,000-mile long, horseshoe-shaped zone that stretches from the southern tip of South America across the West Coast of North America, through the Bering Sea to Japan, and on to New Zealand. This region is where the edges of the Pacific and Nazca plates butt up against an array of other tectonic plates. Importantly, however, the volcanoes of the ring aren't geologically connected. In other words, a volcanic eruption in Indonesia is not related to one in Alaska, and it could not stir the infamous Yellowstone supervolcano. What are some of the dangers from a volcano? Volcanic eruptions pose many dangers aside from lava flows. It's important to heed local authorities' advice during active eruptions and evacuate regions when necessary. One particular danger is pyroclastic flows, avalanches of hot rocks, ash, and toxic gas that race down slopes at speeds as high as 450 miles an hour. Such an event was responsible for wiping out the people of Pompeii and Herculaneum after Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79. Similarly, volcanic mudflows called lahars can be very destructive. These fast-flowing waves of mud and debris can race down a volcano's flanks, burying entire towns. Ash is another volcanic danger. Unlike the soft, fluffy bits of charred wood left after a campfire, volcanic ash is made of sharp fragments of rocks and volcanic glass each less than two millimeters across. The ash forms as the gasses within rising magma expand, shattering the cooling rocks as they burst from the volcano's mouth. It's not only dangerous to inhale, it's heavy and builds up quickly. Volcanic ash can collapse weak structures, cause power outages, and is a challenge to shovel away post-eruption. Can we predict volcanic eruptions? Volcanoes give some warning of pending eruption, making it vital for scientists to closely monitor any volcanoes near large population centers. Warning signs include small earthquakes, swelling or bulging of the volcano's sides, and increased emission of gasses from its vents. None of those signs necessarily mean an eruption is imminent, but they can help scientists evaluate the state of the volcano when magma is building. However, it's impossible to say exactly when, or even if, any given volcano will erupt. Volcanoes don't run on a timetable like a train. This means it's impossible for one to be overdue for eruption no matter what news headlines say. What is the largest eruption in history? The deadliest eruption in recorded history was the 1815 explosion of Mount Tabora in Indonesia. The blast was one of the most powerful ever documented and created a caldera essentially a crater 4 miles across and more than 3,600 feet deep. A superheated plume of hot ash and gas shot 28 miles into the sky, producing numerous pyroclastic flows when it collapsed. The eruption and its immediate dangers killed around 10,000 people. But that wasn't its only impact. The volcanic ash and gas injected into the atmosphere obscured the sun and increased the reflectivity of Earth, cooling its surface and causing what's known as the year without a summer. Starvation and disease during this time killed some 82,000 more people, and the gloomy conditions are often credited as the inspiration for gothic horror tales, such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Although there have been several big eruptions in recorded history, volcanic eruptions today are no more frequent than there were a decade or even a century ago. At least a dozen volcanoes erupt on any given day. As monitoring capacity for and interest in volcanic eruptions increases, coverage of the activity more frequently appears in the news and on social media. As Erik Klemetti, associate professor of geosciences at Denison University, writes in The Washington Post: The world is not more volcanically active, we're just more volcanically aware.  There are 25 known volcanic fields in New Mexico. Volcanoes and volcanic landforms are abundant, well-exposed, and un-eroded in New Mexico, so there are many opportunities to use New Mexico examples for understanding physical volcanology characteristics. And one of the great rift valleys of Earth, the Rio Grande rift, also cuts through the middle of New Mexico. Both features have played an important role in shaping both the landscape and the unique culture of the New Mexico that we know today. A QUICK LOOK AT SOME IMPORTANT VOLCANOES AND VOLCANIC AREAS OF NEW MEXICO Below is a brief overview of the top recommended places for beginning volcanologists to explore New Mexico's volcanic past and imagine its future.

With a paved road to the summit crater, a rim trails and a trail to the bottom of the crater, this is one of the most accessible volcanoes in the country. El Malpais National Monument and Zuni Bandera Volcanic Field 72 miles west of Albuquerque. This is "Hawaii in the desert Southwest" and gives visitors an opportunity to see primary lava flow structures. Many terms used to descibe fresh lava flows were originally defined from studies in this area. Petroglyph National MonumentAlbuquerque's west side. The petroglyphs were etched on lava flows that erupted from a classic fissure eruption. This site includes both unusual small-scale volcanic features and some typical examples of the interior of lava flows. Rio Puerco Volcanic Necks 30 miles west of Bernalillo. This offers visitors one of the best views in the world of the near-surface interiors of small volcanoes. And the setting is classic Southwest, with buttes and mesas. Valles Caldera 40 miles west-northwest of Santa Fe. This is a monument to New Mexico's undiscovered potential. Quite simply, from the perspective of morphology, the Valles Caldera is a better example of a supervolcano than Yellowstone. It is the "poster-child" for large calderas. Valley of Fires State Recreation Area 3 miles west of Carrizozo. One of the longest young lava flows in the world, with features often seen in textbook examples of young lava flows. Zuni Salt Lake Crater County Road 601 between Fence Lake and Quemado. This classic young volcanic crater formed explosively when hot magma encountered ground water. It is one of dozens of explosive craters, called "maars" by geologists, occurring throughout New Mexico RED HILL VOLCANIC FIELD AND ZUNI SALT LAKE MAAR Location: 33 degrees  50' to 34 degrees  39' N , 108 degrees  25' to 108 degrees  00' W, Catron County Type: Cluster of monogenetic scoria cones, maars, and associated lava flows. Age: 0.9 Ma to 0.023 Ma Significance: Several youthful maars and significant neotechtonic structures; Zuni Salt lake maar is a classic youthful hydromagmatic crater Composition: Mostly alkali basalts and intermediate compositions Red Hill Volcanic Field Information about the Red Hill field is sparse, but existing geologic mapping and age determinations show that the area has been active over times significant enough for inversion of topography to occur. As a result, areas of younger volcanism are surrounded by basalt capped mesas on both sides of Highway 60 about 24 miles east of the border with Arizona and Springerville field. Information about the Red Hill field is sparse, but existing geologic mapping and age determinations show that the area has been active over times significant enough for inversion of topography to occur, that is, areas of younger volcanism are surrounded by basalt capped mesas on both sides of Highway 60 about 24 miles east of the border with Arizona and Springerville field. Zuni-Bandera-El-Malpais Lava Flow Several basaltic centers erupted relatively long lava flows within a broad valley between the east end of the Zuni Mountains and Cebolleta Mesa. The youngest flow, the McCartys lava flow, is the youngest eruption in New Mexico. This lava is a classic pahoe hoe lava flow and is about 40 km long. The extreme northern distal end of the lava flow lies within the Rio San Jose Valley at modern day I-40. Another young lava flow of aa type lava characteristics, erupted from a small basaltic cone within the Zuni Mountains flowed north through a canyon and out onto the valley of the Rio San Jose near modern day Grants and I-40. ZUNI-BANDERA FIELD AND MCCARTY'S LAVA FLOW FIELD Location: 35 degrees  N, 108 degrees  W, Cibola County Type: Holocene scoria cones, shield volcanoes, spatter cones and lava flows Age: 3 ka to 0.8 Ma Significance: Youthful volcanic field; the McCartys lava flow is one of the youngest and longest lava flows on the continent. Composition: Alkali basalt, hawaiite, tholeiite cones, craters, and fissures. Geological Overview The volcanoes and associated lava flows in this area are among the youngest eruptions in New Mexico. The lava flows are unusually long lava flows and have covered most of the broad valley between the e Zuni Mountains on the west and Cebolleta Mesa on the east. The youngest flow, the McCartys lava flow field, is the youngest eruption in New Mexico. An inflated pahoehoe type lava flow,  it is  40 km long and retains characteristic surface glass tachylite, and other millimeter-scale features typical of fresh lava flows. The extreme northern distal end of the lava flow lies within the Rio San Jose Valley at modern day I-40. Another young lava flow of mostly aa type lava characteristics, erupted from a small basaltic cone within the Zuni Mountains flowed north through a canyon and out onto the valley of the Rio San Jose near modern day Grants and I-40. And other flows erupted from the larger cinder cones within the Zuni-Bandera volcanic field at the southern margin of the Zuni Mountains. The McCartys Lava flow is the youngest eruption in the Zuni-Bandera field. The lava flow parallels the modern route of NM 117 and retains most of the primary lava characteristics like these  lava crusts or shells several centimeters thick that were broken, jumbled, and remain where they formed several thousand years ago. Aerial, low altitude view of inflation pits near the south end of the McCartys lava flow field. Note that the low areas were sunsequently flooded with lava in this scene. Some of the deep cracks visible in the surface of the lava would have required cooling of the lava for months in order to create a crust thick enough to crack to depths visible. The view is directed northward. Photo L.Crumpler McCarty lava flow field southern edge, NM 117 from about 20,000'. The white spot on the right edge of the lava flow is the parking lot and trail head for the Lava Falls Trail. Photo L. Crumpler Guide to Lava Falls Trail at the south end of the McCartys Lava flow field , A Brief Text Description Guide to the Lava Falls Trail area, McCartys Lava flow: Numbers refer to locations shown on overhead image above. -L. S. Crumpler The eastern margin of the lava flow from here to the southern tip consists largely of coalesced multiple divergent sheet lobes. As we will see on the traverse, the last emplaced part of the lava flows here were trapped between an existing steep margined sheet lobe and the eastward rising ground surface. This means that the flow margins on the east side represent about as far as the flow could advance with the hydraulic gradient resulting from the thickness of the initial sheet lobes here. The surface of the lava flow slopes eastward and consists of a sub-centimeter scale granular or knobby texture common on many pahoehoe lava flows. In addition, a prominent lineation occurs here distinguished by a parallel ridge-and-furrow pattern consisting of relief between ridges and adjoining grooves or furrows on the order of a centimeter to a few centimeters wavelength. The ridge-and-furrow texture is common across many of the broader elevated surfaces and it commonly strikes in a uniform direction over the space of a hundred meters or so. In this area near the beginning of the trail the lineations are oriented generally east-west or perpendicular to the local flow margin. Also, here at the trailhead, note that the surface of the lava flow is an oxidized brownish color and consists of exposed vesicles. This is somewhat atypical for the McCartys lava flow field. For most of the McCartys Lava flow field, the upper few millimeters consist of black glassy chilled surface tachylite. In detail, this black glassy rind commonly consists of extremely stretched vesicles, but less commonly can include dripstone patterns and micro ropes. Here at the lava falls trail the black glassy outer layer is largely removed and a dark oxide brown vesicular surface prevails. Patches of dark glassy material are present , but just not widespread as on much of the McCartys lava flows. Much of the lithic debris from removal of the glassy rind is collected in hollows and forms a fine crunchy soil, the fragments of which often preserve the glassy surfaces. The origin of the differences in glass retention is unclear. There are many examples where two flow lobes, side by side, have dramatically different glass retention. This observation suggest that the conditions of the environment or the particular batch of lava itself at the time of emplacement may exert a strong influence on the surface characteristics and whether glass is retained over the long term. The surface changes to generally smooth plates 3 to 5 meters across. Locally small squeeze-ups along the margins of individual plates are evidence that the surface crust was relatively thin when the plates were deformed. This is a type of surface fairly common to many pahoehoe flows and is characterized by upwardly convex plates, or "swales." The process of swale formation is as yet to be understood, but it is common in areas where the flow surface cooled initially with minimal shearing, such as in ponded areas or margins of newly spread sheet lobes. Near the 100 m point, over a distance of less than 10 m along the traverse, some of these plates are up-ended and locally jumbled by local shearing strains.  To the immediate south there is a circular depression approximately 18 m in diameter. This is part of a north-south striking zone of similar slab deformation for several hundred meters north and south. Individual plates are several tens of centimeters thick. From basic heat transfer and observations of active lava flows, we know the approximate time intervals required to develop crusts of different thickness on basaltic lava flows. Based on this we can estimate that the lava flow surface was less than an hour old when the deformation occurred.Over the next 100 meters note the presence of shallow circular depressions, particularly one on the left southwest along the traverse at about 150 m. A common morphology for these is a depression from 10 to 20 meters across, encircled by deep cracks or clefts. The depression itself is frequently characterized by a V-shaped profile. Small lava features such as squeeze-outs and break-outs may occur on the marginal slopes leading into the depression. Deep clefts along the margins of a few rare examples of this type may even preserve tooth-paste-like squeeze-outs. Others, though less common, are escarpment-bounded along their inner margins and flat floored. For many years the circular depressions like these were interpreted to be the results of collapse following draining of lava tubes during the waning stages of the flow. Recently it has been shown that these are lava rise pits and that the profiles and evidence for crustal thickness during deformation are more consistent with the processes of inflation in which the pits literally represent uninflated zones where the upper crust and floor were not separated by melt. Such areas might occur particularly in association with underlying relief such as where an overflowing sheet lobe is thinner and the section more quickly chilled and solidified. A few examples of cleft ridges in the underlying older Hoya de Cibola flow occupy some depressions here on the south end of the McCartys flow field. The immediate lava surface here is relatively low in relief features and consist of a large flat mosaic of fractured surfaces. The strike of ridge-and-furrow lineations described earlier are here oriented southwest-northeast which is nearly at a right angle to those near the margin at the starting point of the traverse. This is probably the core of the main sheet lobe that was moving southwest at this site. The surface of the flow is again disrupted in a series of contorted slabs and ropes. Most of the deformation is again within sheets with thickness of a few tens of centimeters. Here we move off of the area of broad plates or swales, and into a part of the flow surface that begins to gradually descend to the west. In this area large deep cracks or clefts also begin to be more common. Some of these clefts are 4 to 5 meters deeps.     If we explore the interior of the wider clefts, we will see evidence for some semi-plastic-to-brittle transition in the mechanical properties of the lava as though crack tips were keeping pace with the solidification. Where the clefts are several meters deep, this means that the flow was still deforming several months after initial emplacement. Over the next one hundred meters note the two 20 to 30 m wide shallow depressions on the left. Several large clefts striking NE-SW through this part of the flow are deflected and encircle these depressions. Meanwhile the ridge-and-furrow texture is unaffected. Our interpretation is that the ridge-and-furrow patterns developed in the thin initial sheet lobe, and that the broad depressions developed during large inflation of the lava flow. The surface of the lava flow starts to descend to the west. Ahead is a low trough between this elevated part of the flow and a somewhat more elevated pine-tree-covered plateau in the distance. As we move forward note that the local relief appears more chaotic. Where ridge-and-furrow patterns are present they may change orientation rapidly within a few meters. This surface abruptly contacts the steep margins of a 5 to 6 m high rise in the terrain beyond. Note that the local relief appears much rougher at scales of a few meters. Where ridge-and-furrow patterns are present they may change orientation rapidly within a few meters. This type of pattern is common to lower areas within the flow field. Indicators of flow direction such as ropes, ridge-and furrow-lineations, and short flow lobes are frequently different from the inferred overall direction of flow within the regional field.  distinct contact occurs between the lava flows that we have just traversed and the lower slopes of the plateau ahead.  The plateau is from 5 to 10 m higher than the flows we just traversed and the flows appear to have lapped onto a somewhat brownish flow surface forming the lower slopes of the plateau margin. If one traces out the local shapes it is apparent that the digitate-shaped brown flow or flow-lobe also appears to onlap the plateau. And the adjacent sloping surface of the lavas forming the plateau margin onlapped by this brown lobe are characterized by a distinctive aggregation of 10 to 20 cm diameter balls where not covered by ridge-and-furrow or ropey textures. The contact between the brown lava and the plateau is also considerably elevated from the lower margins of the plateau.   First it is clear that there are at least three separate flow units here which would account for the two on-lapping contacts of lava bearing distinctive textures. An alternative to the above interpretation is that the brown lobe initiated near its highest point on the margin as a type of late squeeze-out that flowed down the margins of the plateau, and was subsequently overlain by later flows as the surrounding flow field emplacement progressed. There are many similar occurrences throughout the flow field, some of which are more convincing than others. This station is located on the surface of the plateau and lies some 5 to 10 meters above the surrounding flow field. Unlike much of the flow field this surface is relatively flat-lying: surface relief across 100 m distances is less than 10 cm on average as measured by differential GPS methods Zimbelman, personal communication. Strong ridge-and-furrow textures are a dominant characteristic of this surface and imply that the initial sheet lobe flow directions were roughly northeast-southwest in this vicinity. Note that the strike of the lineation changes slightly over 100 m scales, but generally it is locally uncorrelated with the current existing large-scale relief. There are many localities where the local lineations strike right across significant relief features such as pits, depressions, and even plateau margins.  The interpretation is that the lineations and the relief characteristics developed at different times. This is a good place to note the clear on-lapping contact between the small flow lobes constituting the surrounding lava field and the plateau, also sometimes known as a "lava rise." The surrounding flows clearly post-date the formation of the plateau margin. The Lava Falls: are actually a small only meter-scale width lava drip that poured over the rim of a local depression during the course of a local breakout from one of the many small toes or lobes that make up the chaotic valley floor. A walk up the slope of the plateau margin just west of this location is useful for examining the size and depth of clefts that occur in these plateau. Depths of cracks in excess of 8 m have been documented in this area. Some of the deepest cracks occur along the tip of the digitate-shaped ridges. Locally there are examples of lava breakouts that flood the floor of some clefts, or that spill out to flood surrounding surfaces. An example of the latter may be seen on the north wall of the large circular depression immediately to the west at this location. In still other locations the cracks opened in semi-brittle to semi-plastic solids resulting in distinctive wall textures. The return route starts here at Lava Falls: From lava falls traverse 100m bearing N160E to a surface just east of a prominent cleft ridge. The cleft ridge in question is locally enshrouded by later lava flows. The lava flow surface slopes up and east. This is equivalent to station 5 and marks the western margin of the central elevated region on the east margin of the lava flow field. East of this point the traverse moves back onto the zone of large, generally horizontal surfaces consisting of  plates and local deformation of centimeters-thick slabs. Lava shatter zone. Here the surface consists of fragments of centimeter-thick scoriaceous crust broken and apparently tumbled along a zone that strikes roughly northeast-southwest, trending through a small local depression before striking more southerly down-flow . This is an example of one of the many surface textures that are evidence for relatively thin one to two meter thick sheet lobes being dominated during the initial emplacement of the lava flow. Similar features have been observed forming on active lava flows  and are a surface characteristic of  lava tubes and channels associated with fast-moving lava. This particular example is aligned with some of the deformation zones we crossed on the flow earlier station  From here to station 14 the traverse crosses a surface consisting of a large mosaic of fractures enclosing 2- to 3-meter scale convex surfaces similar to that seen between station 2 and 4 on the out-going leg of the traverse. The lava flow surface begins to gradually descend to the east. Here the surface morphology changes again and becomes more complex in relief, while gradually stepping down to the elevation of the pre-lava landscape. As at stations 1 and 2, the dominant ridge-and-furrow surface lineation indicators of flow direction here tend to be eastward, in contrast to the more southwesterly trend noted in the strike of ridge-and-furrow textures between station 13 and 14. Navajo Volcanic Field Shiprock The Narbona Pass also "Washington Pass" volcano is a little known example of the explosive vent structures that may have been common to many of the Navajo volcanic field volcanoes before they were eroded to their current deeper levels of exposure. Narbona Pass volcano is a volcanic crater that formed from violent explosive activity. Filling with lava and ash between explosive phases of the eruption resulted in a complex intermingling of sheets of thick trachytic lava flows and plugs.Summary The Navajo Dine volcanic field extends from Gallup and Farmington, New Mexico to Window Rock, Arizona. It consists of the eroded remains of very old volcanoes that erupted around 30 million years ago. The best-known landform in the field is the volcanic neck, Ship Rock, the eroded roots of a very large volcano. The Chuska Mountains are the eroded surfaces of old explosive volcanoes. The rock types in this volcanic field are unusual in chemistry. The Navajo volcanic field is a diffuse group of intrusions, dikes, and some extrusive rocks of early Neogene mid-Cenozoic age scattered between Gallup and Farmington, New Mexico and Window Rock, Arizona. The most famous intrusion is Ship Rock. Intrusive rocks in the Navajo volcanic field, like most of those elsewhere within Colorado Plateaus province, include some unusual ultramafic rocks such as minette, vogesite, and kimberlite as well as altered and serpentinized basaltic tuff and tuff breccia. As a rule, these types of volcanic rocks are representative of magmas that derived from deep within the continental lithosphere and from a mantle source that is somewhat different in composition than "typical" mantle. For example, the rock called minette consists of alkali feldspar, biotite or phlogopite, and diopside. Diopside which is a pyroxene, phlogopitic biotite and olivine all occur as phenocrysts very large crystals in many hand samples. The Buell Park diatreme, which consists of kimberlite, is also part of the field. Kimberlite is the host rock for diamonds in many places in the world, because kimberlite is erupted from great depths where diamonds are initially formed. Both Buell Park and the Green Knobs are ultramafic breccias and consist mostly of serpentinized olivine and pyroxene. Ship rock is thought to represent the near-surface interior of a maar-type steam blast eruption. It is an intrusive rock that is  called a volcanic neck. It is 500 m in diameter at its greatest width, and rises 600 m above the surrounding plains. It consists of tuff breccia and fractured and comminuted broken up host rocks with thin, sheet-like intrusions of minette, an unusual rock type, locally cutting through the entire mass. The intrusion is estimated to have been emplaced at a minimum depth of 750 and a maximum depth of 1000 m below the original surface. The surrounding host rocks at the current surface current level of erosion are late Cretaceous in age and of marine origin, and called the Mancos Shale. Six dikes radiate from a point just west of the central intrusion, the three largest are 9, 4, and 3 km in length and trend S12 degrees E, N80 degrees W, and N55 degrees E respectively. The other three dikes are approximately parallel to the northern dike, trend N55 degrees E, and are less than 1 km in length. Several small plugs occur along the length of some of these dikes. The northeast dike is actually segmented into 35 short dikes with intervening Mancos Shale. The dikes range from 0.6 to 4.6 m in width and 8 to 395 m long. Each dike segment is oriented somewhat differently from adjacent dike segments, and the pattern as a whole is not strictly en echelon. However, the trend of all the segments together is remarkably linear. This suggests that they are segmented from a larger dike that occurs at depth. The central intrusion appears not to have strongly disturbed local sedimentary strata, which are flat-lying adjacent to the intrusion. Considerable amounts of the host rock have, however, slumped into the throat of the intrusion along the margins. Locally the breccias consist of broken and fragmented sedimentary materials with rare fragments of minette and biotite mixed within the breccia. As is common with  many volcanic necks, the mixture of comminuted broken and fragmented sandy host material and juvenile material is so extreme in the breccias that it is often difficult to distinguish the difference between sedimentary and volcanic materials in a hand specimen. Near the top and along some of the margins of Ship Rock there is distinct inward-slumping and inward-dipping stratification of the tuff breccia. This configuration is typical of the structure seen in the smaller and much younger Rio Puerco volcanic necks of the Mount Taylor Volcanic Field located farther east. Based on this, the current level of exposure of the volcano's roots is interpreted to be within several hundred meters below the original summit volcanic crater. Additional evidence is provided by the observed maximum thickness of the Tertiary-age Chuska Sandstone. In addition to sedimentary materials, some rounded cobbles of crystalline basement rocks occur within the tuff breccia. And some breccia bodies consist almost entirely of comminuted fragmented host rocks. Calcite and calcite veins are common throughout many of the breccia masses. All of this evidence confirms the interpretation that Ship Rock is a part of the volcano's roots that originally formed several hundred meters below the original volcanic edifice. Note that Ship Rock is on the Navajo Nation and is considered sacred to the Navajos. Viewing is allowed; but it is off limits to hikers and climbers. Diatremes Another type of volcanic feature within the Navajo field are diatremes. A diatreme is the eroded root subsurface features of a very explosive steam-blast volcanism that erupted rocks from great depths. The diatremes named the Green Knobs are visible to the left of the curve in the road. They are green in color, due to mostly serpentinized olivine and pyroxene minerals within the rocks, and they stand out markedly from the surrounding sedimentary rocks as seen from the air. Narbona Pass Volcano The Narbona Pass also Washington Pass volcano, in the Chuska Mountains, is a little known example of the explosive vent structures that may have been common to many of the Navajo Volcanic Field volcanoes before they were eroded to their current deeper levels of exposure. The crater shape of Narbona is located on the upper surface of the broad mesa-like Chuska Mountains. This surface is some 300 to 400 m above the surface surrounding Ship Rock and similar intrusive structures of the Navajo field. Therefore, it is possible that Narbona is a preserved surface expression of the type of volcanism responsible for Ship Rock, and that Ship Rock is a deeper exposure of the conduit for a Narbona-type volcano. Narbona volcano itself must be considerably eroded given that it would be a surface remnant of early Neogene age. The crater shape could be a function of the erosion of a relatively easily removed former volcanic cone. More information is needed to understand this volcano DATIL-MOGOLLON VOLCANIC FIELD Location: 32 degrees  00' to 34 degrees  30' N, 106 degrees  30' to 109 degrees  00' W, Socorro County Type: Field of ash-flow calderas and associated volcanic rocks Age: Mid-Cenozoic; 36 Ma to 24 Ma Significance: A collection of giant calderas sites of "super eruptions" from the beginning of New Mexico's "Age of Volcanoes", the mid- Cenozoic. Composition: Rhyolite, quartz latite These are older volcanoes and volcanic rocks dating from the Neogene. They represent part of the great ignimbrite flare-up that occurred throughout the Southwest at this time. Many of these eruptions resulted in large calderas similar to the modern Vallis Caldera. However, 20 to 35 million years of erosion and faulting have erased most of the morphology of large calderas. Today this area is dominated by masssive cliffs of ash flow tuffs and exposures of shallow batholiths consisting of granitic and intermediate volcanic rocks.

Today this area is dominated by massive cliffs of ash flow tuffs and exposures of shallow batholiths consisting of granitic and intermediate volcanic rocks. Cross section and state of preservation of an idealized Datil-Mogollon supervolcano. The concept is simple: The current state of preservation is the result of a Valles Caldera type volcano that has been chopped up by Basin and Range faulting and eroded. The result is a chaotic combination of shallow intrusions and surface morphology. Lavas and tuffs erupted from andesitic to silicic volcanoes, domes, and calderas coalesced to form the Mogollon-Datil volcanic field in southwestern New Mexico between ~24 to 40 million years ago. This feature, which includes the mountainous terrain of the Gila Wilderness, covers 40,000 square kilometers. First, andesite volcanoes erupted across this region 40 to 36 million years ago. Later, both basaltic andesite volcanoes and silicic calderas formed between 36 and 24 million years ago. The field is composed of two caldera complexes that were active at about the same time. The oldest eruptions of the southern complex occurred in the Organ Mountains near Las Cruces about 36 million years ago. Volcanic activity migrated from the Organ Mountains toward the northwest 220 km, ending with the eruption of the 28 million year old Bursum caldera located northwest of Silver City. Caldera formation in the northern complex started near Socorro about 32 million years ago and migrated toward the southwest. The Mogollon-Datil volcanic field is part of a discontinuous belt of middle Cenozoic volcanism that runs from the Sierra Madre Oriental in central Mexico, through the Trans-Pecos volcanic field in west Texas, and northward to the San Juan volcanic field in southwestern Colorado. Extension began in this region about 36 million years ago, creating normal faults and distinct mountain blocks with intervening sediment -filled valleys. The extensional faults trend north-south on the east side of the field, northeast on the northwest side of the field, and northwest on the southwest side of the field. The Chino Santa Rita and Tyrone mines near Silver City on the southwest side of the volcanic field are in mineralized, older plutons that are 55-70 million years old. The copper that was dispersed throughout the plutons was concentrated by weathering when these rocks were eroded and brought to the surface prior to the eruption of the younger 24 to 40 million year old volcanic rocks. The younger volcanic rocks covered the concentrated copper mineralization, protecting it from removal by erosion. MT. TAYLOR VOLCANIC FIELD Location: 35 degrees  13' N latitude, 107 degrees  35' W longitude, Cibola County Type: Composite volcano Age: Late Pliocene; 3.9 Ma to 1.7 Ma Significance: Second largest young volcano in New Mexico; classic composite volcano; long-lived history and complete development Composition: rhyolite, trachyandesite latite, trachydacite, trachyte, alkali basalt and hawaiite debris flows, viscous breccias and clastogenic debris flows Mount Taylor is typical of many composite cones and consists of a conglomeration of many volcanic centers of many different magma compositions, all more or less clustered around a small area. The large scale symmetry is largely a result of the accumulation of fairly thick and viscous trachydacitic and trachyandesitic lavas later in the history of the volcano and an outward-radiating apron of debris shed off of these domes mixed with late pyroclastic materials. View of Mount Taylor volcano from the south at an altitude of approximately 20,000 ft. The Mount Taylor volcanic field consists of a collection of scoria cones, maars, and trachyte domes extending north and east as Mesa Chivato from the base of the Mount Taylor edifice. Mount Taylor is typical of many composite cones and consists of a conglomeration of many volcanic centers with many different magma compositions, all more or less clustered around a small area. The large scale symmetry is largely a result of the accumulation of fairly thick and viscous trachydacitic and trachyandesitic lavas later in the history of the volcano and an outward-radiating apron of debris shed off of these domes mixed with late pyroclastic materials. After the initial rhyolite eruptions, domes and thick viscous flows of trachyandesite and trachydacite began to erupt from various centers. Much of the late history involved emplacement of thick, viscous flows, and debris flows from flow domes of trachydacite near the summit. The more viscous trachydacitic domes tended to be extruded high up on the accumulated volcanic mass. Consequently, their precarious perch on the higher elevations, together with the abundance of snow or water in the upper volcano, led to frequent collapses and avalanching of the hot and/or muddy debris down the flanks of the growing pile of volcanic material. Radial dikes of trachydacite in the summit amphitheater were probably feeder dikes for many of the viscous extrusions. Collapse and extrusion of viscous flows along with occasional basaltic lava flows contributed to the final external accumulations to the volcano. There may have been a recurring pyroclastic cone near the center of this extrusive activity that also contributed to the abundant loose materials that now litter the lower flanks of the volcano with fine light-colored ash and large house-size blocks of trachydacite.The extent to which a summit pyroclastic cone occupied the center of the volcano is undetermined. However, outcrops of intermediate composition ash and scoria on the amphitheater walls suggest that a pyroclastic cone may have occupied the summit originally. Both erosion and late explosive modification could have played a role in the destruction of the summit. The current morphology of Mount Taylor is that of a truncated cone, centered on a point located at the head of Water Canyon within the large summit amphitheater-shaped valley and just east of Mount Taylor peak and La Mosca peak. This amphitheater has the shape of a large crater, although the relative contributions of erosion versus late-stage Mount St. Helens-like lateral collapse are debated. The San Francisco Mountain volcano near Flagstaff Arizona, some 0.5 Ma younger, is probably a good analog for the appearance of Mount Taylor as late as 0.5 to 1 million years ago. There is good evidence that late collapse of the east flank occurred at San Francisco Mountain. A similar event could well have been involved at Mount Taylor volcano. The original height of the volcano is a question frequently asked by laymen. Estimates of the original height are fraught will all sorts of potential error, largely because of the extreme individuality of most volcanoes. Long-lived volcanoes similar to Mount Taylor experience erosion in many cases that continually worries away the steep and loosely consolidated summits even while the volcano is active. As a result, not all the materials erupted succeed in adding to the summit before limited erosion removes it prior to the next eruption. If the summit pyroclastic cone was well-developed, an original cone topping out at 13,000 to 14,000 feet is within reason. Many cones evolve through several stages of growth and collapse, as well as multiple summits, rather than a single conical mass, resulting in a more rounded and lumpy summit. If the near-terminal morphology attained this form, then 12,000 to 13,000 feet, may be a better estimate of the original height. Mount Taylor is a composite rhyolitic to intermediate trachytic composition stratovolcano that was active >3.3 to 1.5 million years ago  Composite stratovolcanoes are usually made of lava flows interbedded with ash flow tuffs and pumice that form during explosive eruptions and volcaniclastic sediment sediment related to erosion of the cone. Mount Taylor is a classic composite cone in nearly every respect Figure 4 except that only 10% of the cone is made of tuff and pumice, a low volume compared to other volcanoes of this type. A 3.73 - 0.09 million year old basanite flow sitting on Cretaceous sandstone at the north end of Horace Mesa is the oldest volcanic unit dated so far in the Mount Taylor field. The oldest volcanic unit exposed in the bottom of the cone's amphitheater is a 3.3 million year old trachyte dome or flow. This trachyte dome is most likely related to trachytic volcanism to the northeast on Mesa Chivato and is not directly associated to the formation of the Mt. Taylor cone. After these initial eruptions, rhyolite 70 to 75% silica lava erupted during the early history of the buildup of the volcanic cone, followed by trachydacite 63 to 70 % silica, and finally trachyandesite 58-63% silica. In general, the composition of the lavas on the cone became more mafic through time. Most of the cone formed between 3 and 2.6 million years ago and trachydacite makes up more than 65 % of the cone. Basalt eruptions occurred through the lifetime of the volcano, although relatively little basalt erupted prior to the formation of the bulk of the cone. Most of the basalt in the Mount Taylor volcanic field erupted after the cone formed, erupting from vents around the volcano, with the basalt flows lapping onto the edge of the cone and spreading out over erosion surfaces. Most of the basalt is trachybasalt hawaiite, but flows ranging from basanite to trachyte in composition are also present LUCERO VOLCANIC FIELD Location: 34 degrees 42' N, 107 degrees  20' W, Valencia County Type: Basaltic shield volcano, scoria cones, associated lava flows; older basaltic mesas Age: ~8.3 Ma to ~1.1 Ma Composition: Basanite, alkali basalt, theoleiitic basalt.

Crumpler Rio Puerco/Cabezon Volcanic Necks There is no other place on Earth where the interiors of young volcanoes are so well exposed as in the Rio Puerco. Cabezon is one of many massive dark peaks known as volcanic necks that are scattered throughout the Rio Puerco valley between Mesa Chivato and Mesa Prieta on the west and east, and San Luis and I-40 on the north and south. Together with Mesas Chivato and Prieta they are part of the Mount Taylor volcanic field, a cluster of several hundred small volcanoes. A few volcanic necks, including Cerro Alesna, occur on the west side of Mesa Chivato. Other examples around the south margin of the Mount Taylor field include half-sectioned volcanoes east Grants Ridge and deeply dissected volcanoes Cubero volcano. JORNADA DEL MUERTO VOLCANO Location: 33 degrees 28' to 33 degrees 40' N, 106 degrees 42' to 107 degrees 08' , Socorro County Type: Basaltic shield volcano / lava field Age: 760,000 years Significance: Large volume, young age, unusual vent structure, and other-worldly isolation; significant lava inflation in surrounding field Composition: Alkali basalt Jornada del Muerto Volcano Location: 33? 28' to 33? 40' N, 106? 42' to 107? 08' , Socorro County Type: Basaltic shield volcano / lava field Age: 760,000 years Significance:Large volume, young age, unusual vent structure, and other-worldly isolation As with many large volume lava flow field in New Mexico the central vent region is dominated by a distinct circular platform. View of the central vent platform from the southern lava tubes. The lava tubes here are the site of one of the Southwest's great mass nightly bat flights. The Jornada del Muerto the modern idiom for the Medieval Spanish would be Dead Man's Route was not always unvisited. For two hundred years after the first permanent Spanish settlement in 1598, most of the movement along the Camino Real de Tierra Adentro between Mexico City and the interior of Nuevo Mexico passed through the valley just to the west of this lava flow. Today it is about as remote as any place in New Mexico.  It lies on the western edge of the White Sands Missile Range and was illuminated in 1945 by the world's first atomic explosion in the valley to the immediate east. About 760,000 years ago lava flows spread out over 170 square miles 440 square kilometers of the central Rio Grande rift valley. Before the eruption finished many years later about 13 cubic kilometers of basaltic lava had accumulated, about the same volume as the Laki fissure eruption that occurred in 1783 in Iceland. The total volume is  greater than the much younger McCartys El Malpais and Carrizozo lava flows by a factor of two, so the Jornada accumulation ranks among the larger of the geologically young basaltic eruptions on Earth. Technically-speaking, the whole field is a volcano or, more specifically, a shield volcano. The topographic relief in the accompanying map shows that the surface is built up to a central platform with lava flows sloping radially away for 360 degrees around the central vent, the basic physiographic definition of a volcano. Primary surface features of the lava flows are relatively well-preserved for their age due to the arid environment. Cone on central vent platform. The central volcanic vent from which the lavas erupted consists of an unusual raised elongated platform of basalt surmounted on the northern end by a small cinder cone. From a distance the profile of this platform resembles a squat cone, the flat-top of which is a little over one-quarter mile 0.5 km in width. The platform consists of relatively smooth lava surface that is broadly down-sagged toward the center and broken here and there by abrupt escarpments and cracks. The outer edge of the platform is surrounded by a wide moat-like crack and outward-sloping sheets of basalt that form a rampart sloping down to the surrounding lava surface. Other large lava flows in New Mexico exhibit this type of platform type morphology in the vent area include the McCartys lava flow and El Tintero volcano. The Jornada vent is an unusually inaccessible example of this type of  structure. Opening to lava tube in the Jornada del Muerto flows The lava flows are dominantly inflated pahoehoe. A series of partially collapsed lava tubes approximately 1 mile south of the vent complex occur as a disconnected series of sinuous troughs. Because the lava tubes support a substantial colony of bats, the open tubes are a popular site for wild life biologists.  The floors of the Jornada caves are covered with bat droppings and were once commercially mined. A few small wooden structures remain from that operation south of the vent region and at the end of the only road into the volcano's interior. Some of the lava tubes are gigantic. No doubt other lava tubes occur throughout the field that are uncollapsed and undetected. The Jornada del Muerto flows are an outdoor museum of structures developed from inflation or swelling of the flows from within during flow emplacement. These include mesa-like structures, domical swells, and circular troughs. Based on our understanding of the relatively slow manner in which this particular type of lava flow and its lava tubes are formed, it could be estimated that the complete volcano formed in a time period less than 50 years. Since the Jornada del Muerto has been sampled and dated, but not mapped, we cannot say with certainty how the unusual vent structure was created. But based on knowledge of some of the ways in which basaltic eruptions occur and my reconnaissance study of the Jornada del Muerto volcano, the vent complex may have started as a lava lake or as an unusual near-vent lava inflation structure. Cooling and draining of the interior of the lava lake or inflation structure during the final stages of the eruption caused the surface to founder and sag. The cinder cone at the north end of the vent complex was probably one of the last events. Ash and cinder eruptions often occur as a final phase, even in eruptions that are on the whole relatively non-explosive. SOCORRO ACTIVE MAGMA BODY Location: 3400'53.7"N, 106 degrees 17'14.0"W; Socorro County Type: Active mid-crustal magma-filled sill Age: Unknown, but geomorphic evidence for long-term uplift in overlying landscape is limited, suggegsting that it is young Significance: One of the best examples of a mid-crustal, seismically "bright" magam boundies in the continental US; Yellowstone and Long Valley caldera are the other two Composition: Unknown A proposed outline of the extent of the magma body relative to the State of New Mexico. This area also roughly outlines the extent of most of the shallow earthquake activity within New Mexico. In the lower right is a depiction oif one possible arrangment of the magam body. Conceptually, dikes periodically ascending from the mantle source stall at the mid-crustal boundary. Flexure of the overlying brittle crust gives rise to the abundant seismicity. The SMB lies at the southern end of the Albuquerque basin part of the Rio Grande rift. It is strictly defined as a mid-crustal anomaly identified by geophysical observations. These include the presence of unusual crustal properties, defined by analysis of the way seismic energy is reflected from the surface of the proposed magma body and transmitted through the crust from distant teleseismic earthquakes, and by the concentrated distribution of earthquakes. These observations define the presence of a crustal anomaly, but it is the close spatial correlation with the Socorro seismic anomaly SSA, one of the most seismically active parts of the rift, that implies volume moments associated with active magma movement. The SSA is a roughly 5000 km2 area of intense micoearthquake activity that coincides with the greater than 3400 km2 area  of the SMB defined from reflection data. Most of the microearth�quakes in the SSA are located between a depth of 4 to 14 km. This is within the brittle zone lying above the approximate 20 km depth of the SMB mid-crustal anomaly. That the seismicity is anomalous is apparent when one considers that 45 percent of the total seismicity above magnitude 2.5 in New Mexico occurs within this area, yet it occupies only 2 percent of the area of the state. Hypotheses for the origin of the microearthquake activity include fractures caused by bending stresses in the brittle upper crust as the magma body inflates and frac�tures are induced during small vertical diking events. The inset in the lower right corner of the state map above and the drawing below is a simplified depiction of a possible configuration of the SMB and its feeder dikes. The salient characteristic is the great width relative to the thickness. Geophysical work to date suggests that the SMB is on the order of 0.1 to 0.5 km thick and contains a volume of 102 to 103 km3 Drawing depicting the geometry of the proposed Socorro magma body. The main body occurs as a sheet roughly 100 m thick spread out at the interface between the upper and lower crust. The volume of actual melt is not well con�strained. Current methods do not resolve whether the region is comprised of a series of sheets sepa�rated by layers of solid or whether the entire layer consists of some large fraction of melt. It is likely that the layer is supplied by frequent arrivals of melt via dikes from the mantle source region. Occasion�ally, some dikes may move upward above the magma body to shallower a few km depths, based on the apparent presence of shallow bodies in the vi�cinity of Socorro LOS LUNAS-TOM�-BLACK BUTTE-LOS PINOS VOLCANOES View west toward Los Lunas volcano from the summit of Tom� volcano. Los Lunas volcano is actually several separate volcanic eruption sites ranging from 3.5 to 1.2 Ma, the most recent eruptions forming the naturally half-sectioned scoria cone on the north end of the complex. The thick basaltic andesite lavs of the inetrmediate vent, dated at 2.5 Ma, form beautiful levees and a circular ponded mass on the east flanks. The basaltic andesite is similar to Tom�volcano, so there may be a genetic link. The Cat Hills volcanic field is on the horizon on the right. Aerial view of Los Lunas volcano directed southeast. The outcrops on the near end are exposures of the near summit flank of a scoria cone naturally sectioned by landslip on the north flank of the complex. Note the very circular ponding of basaltic andesite flows on the volcano's east flank.  I-25 is in the upper left of the image. Tom� volcano is a mass of basaltic andesite. Local scoria and inward-dipping foliations are interpreted to represent shallow to shurface expressions of a volcanic vent and associated thick andesitic lava flows. Tom� volcano is dated at 3.5 Ma. It is the site of an annual Easter Sunday pilgrimage and an historical named site along the El Camino Real de la Tierra Adentro. Black Butte, located in the southern part of the Albuquerque-Belen basin of the Rio Grande rift is actually much older than it appears 24.3 Ma. It is probably a typical early rift basaltic andesite near-surface intrucive, or it could be a severely eroded surface flow. From a distance it appears to be a nice, young cinder cone, but up close it is clear that Black Butte consists entirely of dense basaltic abdesite outcrops. Albuquerque-Cat Hills Volcanic Field Location: 35.2 degrees N, 106.8 degrees  W, Bernalillo County Type: Basaltic fissure eruptions & scoria/spatter cones Age: 190,000 to 220,000 years before present Significance: Young example of a long basaltic fissure eruption, many small volcanologic details preserved and within a few minutes drive of Albuquerque Composition: tholeiitic basalt and smal scoria-spatter cones aligned along fissure The Cat Hills are a series of small scoria cones and associated lava flows erupted on the Llano de Albuqueruque the central floor of the Rio Grande rift and part of Isleta Pueblo lands around 100,00 years ago. These are arguably the youngest volcanoes within the Rio Grande rift. Many of the cones have been quarried for "cinder" and at least one is completely quarried away.This is unfortunate because the cones are unusual landforms, rather uncommon on the North American continent as a whole. Wind Mesa is much older about 4 million years and is technically not a part of the young Cat Hills eruptions but instead represents earlier basaltic eruptions that took place here even earlier. The Rio Grande rift is segmented into a series of basins; the Albuquerque basin being one of them. It is bounded on the north by the La Bajada fault, which defines the southern margin of the Espa�ola basin, and to the south by the Socorro constriction. Volcanism is distributed throughout the ABQ basin and the Albuquerque volcanoes are only one among several young volcanic features near Albuquerque.  Although most of these volcanic areas consist of dark, relatively low silica, and relatively fluid basalt lava flow and scoria eruptions, andesitic and more silicic compositions are represented in some of the volcanic centers, especially at depth within the rift valley basin fill. This means that although volcanism appears to be minor and only manifests itself in a few places in the current rift valley floor, there has been much more  volcanism within the Albuquerque basin segment of the Rio Grande rift over the past several million years and it is simply buried in the sediments filling the rift. We only see some of  the last erutive activity. From most locations in Albuquerque there are several shield volcanoes visible to the north and south in addition to the Albuquerque volcanoes. Many of the mountains visible from Albuquerque, such as the Jemez Mountains to the north and Mount Taylor to the west are relatively young meaning, still morphologically preserved volcanoes. View of the Albuquerque Volcanoes from 10,000 feet. Note the lobe-shaped mesas whose margins outline the original flows. The direction of flow was away from the fissure vent which is visible in this image as an alignment of small cones. Petroglyph National Monument is located along the rocky escarpment. Photo L. Crumpler The Albuquerque Volcanoes exhibit many unique volcanic features and you can see them on a short hike if you know where to look. For example, at the largest cone, "Vulcan volcano", the cone consists mostly of scoria and ash, but  has a carapice of spatter and lava coating the exterior. Gradual weathering of the loose cinders in these places has created cavernous holes. These look like lava tubes but actually were formed by a different process. Then there are other places on the larger cones where lava flowed in small gutters perfectly preserved with the last flows on the gutter floors. Two humps on the south side of Vulcan are actually small volcanoes. You can stand on their tops and actually see the craters surrounded by outward-dipping spatter and lava flows. The Albuquerque Volcanoes are the source of lavas that make up the escarpment of the Petroglyphs National Monument. In places the cliffs are over a hundred feet high. But the lava flows are only six to ten feet thick in most places and occur as a cap rock resting on softer underlying rift basin fill consisting of sands and gravels. The rest of the cliff or petroglyph slope is just armored with blocks of basalt that have tumbled from the relatively thin lava flow cap rock. Judging from these high cliffs at the edge of the lava field, one might also suppose that the volcanoes are old. But the Volcano Cliffs, as they are known locally, formed only because the Rio Grande flow gradually cut down its channel and the lateral erosion of the landscape has encroached on the lava flows from the volcanoes under cutting them and leaving them perched on escarpments. Here is the important thing about the Albuquerque Volcanoes: Few large cities in the United States have young volcanoes near them. The Albuquerque Volcanoes are geologically young dates range between about 190,000 and 220,000 years old so many details of small eruptions are well preserved. What is ironic is the fact that most residents see them as such small hills on the western horizon that they could not possibly be of any interest. But it turns out that they preserve some really unusual characteristics not seen in other more spectacular volcanic settings. They are also an excellent example of the results of a fissure eruption in which a curtain of fire erupts from a long, linear crack. Fissure eruptions like the Albuquerque Volcanoes are common in many parts of the world, particularly oceanic island volcanoes, but are not as well-expressed throughout much of the Southwest. The Albuquerque Volcanoes we see today are the result of a fissure eruption associated with the Rio Grand rift. Fissure eruptions form because molten rock, or magma, tends to rise along vertical cracks. When the cracks reach the surface, they cause long surface fissures.  Lava and ash then erupt from the fissure. As magma quickly cools and solidifies along most of the crack, only a few points continue to erupt. Small cones of ash, spatter, and lava are built as these points of eruption continue.

Crumpler Trail Guide to the Black Volcano, Albuquerque Volcanoes Trail head area. From here one may see three of the main cones that make up the north-south line of cones that are known as the Albuquerque Volcanoes; to the north is Vulcan volcano, then Black volcano, and closest to us is JA volcano. To understand what you are looking at, imagine JA Volcxano to out immediate east with a fire fountain spraying several hundred feet into the air, collapsing into pools on the slopes, and running away in re-hot streams of molten rock. This is what it looked like just before the eruption came to an end and there has been very little erosion since. The mass of the Sandia Mountains, literally the oldest rock in the Albuquerque area 1.4 billion years old, is visible to the east and juxtaposed behind the volcanoes to the east in stark contrast to the 220,000-year age of the volcanoes. The Manzano Mountains are to the southeast. Mount Taylor composite volcano, 2.5 million years old, is visible due west on the horizon. The Mount Taylor summit amphitheater, much like the one that we will walk through on this trail, opens towards us.  The two sides and back of the amphitheater crater give the appearance from Albuquerque of a three-summit mountain. Begin walking up the trail from the parking area toward JA volcano. Notice that each of the volcanoes clearly has a ramp or apron of lavas around their bases Just where the trail approaches near the lower slopes of JA Volcano  there are many white-coated rocks exposed in the trail. This is common in the Southwest. It is called caliche, and is formed by calcium carbonate, similar to the deposits left by hard water around your faucet. There are several hypotheses concerning caliche; it may be formed from ground water, deposited by surface rainfall, or may even be associated with the increased carbon dioxide associated with volcanism. Note that the basalt has many gas bubbles or vesicles. The vesicles are remnants of the gas primarily carbon dioxide gas and water vapor that is inherent in the magma and helps to drive the eruption. Throughout the traverse, note how the vesicle size and number change depending on the type of outcrop features. As you continue on the trail, look for the beginning of a lava flow associated with JA volcano.  Lava flows are mostly to the east because the gradient at the time of eruption was toward the Rio Grande, but the build-up of the fissure line and the main volcanoes created a slope that sent many flows to the west. As you continue to walk, you will climb up on the apron around JA Volcano that was formed from small digitate finger-like, radiating lava flows. These form a platform around the base of the volcano.   The lava flows around Black Volcano and somewhat larger and tended to pond forming a series of steps in the cone slopes. You may be able to see these benches or steps from here. This is the second rest stop along the trail. At this point you are standing on the fissure line between JA volcano and Black volcano to the north. A little-known detail about fissure eruptions and particularly noticeable here in the Albuquerque Volcanoes fissure line is that volcanoes are not exactly aligned along the 10 km fissure trend. Each of the major volcanoes is actually on a separate shorter fissure that trends at a small angle to the northeast from the main trend line. This is because fissures in the deep crust tend to splay into shorter fissures in the upper crust due to peculiarities of the strength of rocks. Think cracks in sidewalks or cracks on a wall. They tend to be en echelon rather than one big, long crack. Notice that Black volcano looks flat-topped from here. That is actually the rim of the summit crater that we will be climbing into. JA Volcano on the south side of the trail is a perfect example of a cinder/spatter cone with associated lava flows. As you walk past JA cone you will see evidence for red-colored scoria and cinder on the lower slopes. Unlike Black Volcano, JA Volcano has more exposures of cinder. Both volcanoes have later flows covering their slopes to the east and west and the cinders tend to be exposed on the north and south flanks. The trail turns north at another rest stop where you have an excellent view of the Rio Grande valley making up the eastern half of the Rio Grande rift. Here on the fissure line of the Albuquerque volcanoes you are standing very near the center of the Rio Grande rift. The rift at the latitude of Albuquerque encompasses the area between the Rio Puerco over the western horizon and the Sandia Mountains on the east side. From here one has an excellent view of the inner valley of the Rio Grande that includes most of the modern flood plain and is bound on the east and west by the sandhills. The river is the gift of the rift and has taken advantage of the low area produced by the rift to flow down the center of the state. This is a good place to consider the diversity of rock ages and landscapes in the Albuquerque area, and evidence for past and present geologic forces, all of which are uniquely visible from this single site. Continue on the trail toward Black Volcano. Notice that very little lava is exposed in the saddle between JA Volcano and Black Volcano. The lava is there, but in this case it has been buried under thousands of years of dust from the west. As you walk up the trail, keep in mind that the lava flows and cinders and spatter erupted here are among the last volcanic material to be erupted from the fissure. Keep an eye open for how the last erupted material may differ from early lavas that make up much of the landscape to our east. First outcrop up on the southeast margin of Black Volcano. The outcrops here are very vesicular, so we are seeing close to the top of uneroded lava flows making up the lower slopes of Black Volcano at this location. But the outcrops are all bulbous and irregular. This is because these are lava flows that have cascaded down the slopes and experience many local breakouts as they cooled and crusted over. As you climb up onto this black basaltic surface notice that the trail is suddenly populated with black vesicular white caliche-covered rocks. See if you can spot any digitate or finger-like flows in the shape of the miscellaneous outcrops on either side of the trail.  There are flows radiating from the volcano. Can you spot them on the ground? The trail passes into the earlier of two overlapping summit craters. Along with general dust and alluvium filling the crater, there are some reddish areas of scoria and ash making up the rim and floor of the cone. It is also a flattish area, with ramparts or margins of the dark basalt that makes up the outside of the volcano. If you look closely as we circle around the craters, you may get a sense of foliations or layers in the basalt that tell us which way the lava was flowing: In? Out? Flat-lying lava pond? While we are up here on this prominent topographic peak, look for fulgarites on some of the boulders surrounding the summit craters. Fulgarites in this area are dark green to black glassy mark around a centimeter in diameter made by lightning strikes. Over 200, 000 years there have been many lightning strikes on these peaks since they are the highest features on the west mesa. The trail enters a slightly higher elevation and the floor of the second crater. . Instead of just general soils and alluvium filling the crater here, the floor of the crater consists of scoria and cinder. The craters have not been eroded and filled all that much with later non-volcanic material. The presence of scoria and cinder here tells us that while the outside of the volcano makes it appear that the whole volcano is just dark basaltic lava, actually the basalt on the slopes is just a coating on a scoria cone much like JA Volcano to the south. This is an original geologic surface; so all the scattered rocks and disturbed features up here are the result of later activity, mostly human. The west rim of the second crater is the highest point on Black Volcano. This is a perfect place to view most of the rift valley. The Sangre de Cristo Mountains may be seen on a clear day to the northeast and just east of Santa Fe. To the east you have an excellent view of the Rio Grande valley and the eastern margin of the Rio Grande rift formed by the fault block Sandia, Manzanita, and Manzano Mountains. In the distance to the northeast is the San Felipe shield volcano on the mesa top above San Felipe Pueblo. To the left of that is the rim of the Valles Caldera. To the south, Isleta and Los Lunas volcanoes are visible in the near distance, and beyond them to the southwest, is Sierra Ladron, which is an uplifted block of the old crystalline  basement rock similar to the Sandia Mountains. Here the basalt appears mostly flat-lying but tips over onto the west slope of the volcano. If you walk 10 feet or so to the west-northwest from the summit you will see a lava gutter. Lava gutters are small lava channels. While they are relatively rare, lava gutters appear to be a specialty of the Albuquerque Volcanoes. If you look carefully enough, each of the volcanoes has several good examples of lava gutters. This particular example emerges from a small lava tunnel that probably drained a summit lava pond. The north rim of the second crater is a well-preserved lava channel complete with levees. Like the lava gutters, but bigger and flat-floored, a leveed lava channel in this location must represent one of the last events in the eruption of Black Volcano. If you look carefully, you can make out the rubbly basalt stuck to the floor of the channel in its last position before everything shut down. In a sense you are looking at a lava stream that was frozen in the channel 200, 000 years ago and has remained that way since. That is an old landscape and a far cry from the mostly recent vegetated and eroded landscape of wetter parts of the continent. Think old-growth forest on steroids. One final feature located on the east margin of this channel is something of a mystery. It is a vertical cylindrical hole in the lava about 10 cm in diameter. Although it could easily be a later flagpole hole, it is not. If you look closely you can see that the original lava itself has faint foliations or bands that wrap around the hole. So it appears to have been an obstacle in the original lava. Anywhere else this would be an excellent candidate for a tree mold. But on the summit of an erupting volcano? We are missing something in our understanding here. Points of interest along the JA volcano trail. Trail head area: From here one may see three of the main cones that make up the north-south line of cones known as the Albuquerque Volcanoes; to the north is Vulcan volcano, then Black volcano, and closest to us is JA volcano. The mass of the Sandia Mountains, literally the oldest rock in the Albuquerque area 1.4 billion years old, is visible to the east and juxtaposed behind the volcanoes to the east in stark contrast to the 220,000-year age of the volcanoes. The Manzano Mountains are to the southeast. Mount Taylor composite volcano, 2.5 million years old, is visible due west on the horizon. The Mount Taylor summit amphitheater, much like the one that we will walk through on this trail, opens towards us.  The two sides and back of the amphitheater crater give the appearance from Albuquerque of a three-summit mountain. Begin walking up the trail from the parking area toward JA volcano. Notice that each of the volcanoes clearly has a ramp or apron of lavas around their bases. Just to the east of the white arrow at the trail side there are many white-coated rocks exposed in the trail. This is common in the Southwest. It is called caliche, and is formed by calcium carbonate, similar to the deposits left by hard water around your faucet. There are several hypotheses concerning caliche; it may be formed from ground water, deposited by surface rainfall, or may even be associated with the increased carbon dioxide associated with volcanism. Note that the basalt has many gas bubbles or vesicles. The vesicles are remnants of the gas primarily carbon dioxide gas and water vapor that is inherent in the magma and helps to drive the eruption. Throughout the traverse, note how the vesicle size and number change depending on the type of outcrop features. As you continue on the trail, look for the beginning of a lava flow associated with JA volcano.  Lava flows are mostly to the east-west because the gradient at the time of eruption was toward the Rio Grande.  As you continue to walk, you will climb up on the apron of small digitate finger-like, radiating lava flows that form a platform around the base of the volcano. This is the second rest stop along the trail. At this point you are standing on the fissure line between JA volcano and Black volcano to the north. Notice that Black volcano looks flat-topped from here. That is actually the rim of the summit crater. To the east you have an excellent view of the Rio Grande valley. Here on the fissure line of the Albuquerque Volcanoes you are standing very near the center of the Rio Grande rift. The rift starts in the area of the Rio Puerco over the western horizon and goes all the way over to the base of the Sandia Mountains. JA volcano is a perfect example of a cinder/spatter cone with associated lava flows. As you walk up JA cone you will see excellent examples of many of the physical and textural features of a cinder cone-style volcano. Start the ascent up the trail toward the summit of JA cone. As you walk up the trail, keep in mind that the lava flows, cinders and spatter erupted here are among the last volcanic material to be erupted from the fissure. Keep an eye open for how the last erupted material may differ from early lavas. First outcrop up on the north flank of JA volcano. small opening surrounded by moss near the edge to west of the trail = moist ambient subsurface air.  Hold your hand in front of this opening do not reach inside and you will feel warm air in winter and cool air in summer. The warm air has made many people believe that the volcano is still active; however, you are simply feeling the ambient air temperature protected by the insulation properties of the basalt. large spatter lumps and agglomerated fluid clasts may be seen in some of the outcrops. Farther up the slope you arrive at a large cave. This may be part of a small lava tube that formed in the lavas that were draining away from the summit of the volcano. Note the odd lumpy shapes of the lava � formed by welded spatter. Notice that above the opening there is a fragment of pre-existing rock sandstone that has been caught up in the eruption. Do not go inside. As you continue up and around the cave and follow the trail you will see a classic lava gutter to your left just above the cave. The layers in the upper walls of the gutter illustrate one way that an open channel or gutter may evolve into a closed tube as an eruption progresses and walls build up and solidify into a roof. The trail passes through a reddish area that is scoria and ash making up the rim of the main crater. It is also a flattish area, with outward dipping margins, that appears to have provided a source for the lava tube and gutter we just walked past, so this is probably a small vent area or short-lived lava pond. The question here is why is some scoria black and some red? The answer is probably small changes in oxygen gas content causing oxidation in some areas and not in others � but this is a question that is still not totally solved by volcanologists. The basalt lava around the margins and just west along the rim here is very dark, but banded as though made up of many pulses. Look for fulgarites glassy marks of lightning strikes on some of the boulders surrounding the lava pond. The outcrops here are bedded or banded, and the plane of the bands slope or dip towards the center of the main crater. Locally the surface of the lava and spatter is grooved; these are stretch marks as the hot and plastic spatter slid down the rim toward the crater. The multiple bands of light and dark lava here shows how the eruption changes back and forth from more solidified pyroclastic clots to fluid clots that are hot enough to weld together. Here on the south rim one may see many separate layers of spatter that built up as the volcano erupted. Walk up the trail to the inward dipping layers of spatter on the west rim of the crater or walk on the trail across the crater to the south rim.   Both sites will give you a close-up view of the welded layers of spatter. Notice the layers of fluid-looking spatter that have welded together to form solid rock.  They were erupted as part of the fire-fountaining of the crater and then fell back into the crater welding into solid rock and forming inward-dipping coating. This is a perfect place to view most of the rift valley. The Sangre de Cristo Mountains may be seen on a clear day to the northeast and just east of Santa Fe. To the east you have an excellent view of the Rio Grande valley and the eastern margin of the Rio Grande rift formed by the fault block Sandia, Manzanita, and Manzano Mountains. In the near distance to the northeast is the San Felipe shield volcano on the mesa top above San Felipe Pueblo. To the south, Isleta and Los Lunas volcanoes are visible in the near distance, and beyond them to the southwest, is Sierra Ladron, which is an uplift similar to the Sandias that marks the western margin of the rift. The low notch on the east side of the crater here is not just the result of water erosion.  If you look carefully, you will see evidence that lava actually poured out the crater here and left behind fins and grooves. As you walk down this notch, you will walk along the geologic contact between the scoria/spatter forming the volcano and the youngest lava flow erupted from the crater late in the history of the cinder cone. The lava that flowed out from this volcano probably supplied the lava flows that make up the escarpment lavas visible way off to the east near Unser Boulevard and Rinconada Canyon. Many of the same features that we have seen in the lava flows here may also be found at the head of Rinconada Canyon. Down here we are off the main cone and on the apron of lava flows. At this point someone has penetrated the lava flows and exposed clinkery cinder that was erupted just before these very last lava flows. The opening has also exposed what may be one of many small discontinuous lava tubes within the lava flows of the Albuquerque volcanic field. The third rest area. From here you have an excellent view of the inner valley of the Rio Grande from the center of the Rio Grande rift. The river is the gift of the rift and has taken advantage of the low area produced by the rift to flow down the center of the state. This is a good place to consider the diversity of rock ages and landscapes in the Albuquerque area, and evidence for past and present geologic forces, all of which are uniquely visible from this single site. And JA volcano is a remarkable example of fissure-style cinder/spatter cone. View directed northward along the 10 km-long fissure line of the Albuquerque Volcanoes. JA volcano is the closest volcano. Note the small digitate lava flows radiating from the volcano. Photo L. Crumpler How old are they? The Albuquerque Volcanoes are as young as 140,000 years. There are several methods of determining ages of basaltic volcanic rocks and each can yield a slightly different result. Some methods yield an age closer to 200,000 years. Ages between 160,000 to 200,000 years old are currently the dates that appear most reasonable based on comparison with geomorphic surfaces around the volcanoes and other factors. Any of these dates are young by the standards of geologic time. Volcanoes younger than 200,000 years in the Southwest are generally well preserved and with the exception of some erosion of their slopes, look close to the morphology they had immediately after eruptions ceased. Rather than erupting individually like many small fields of volcanoes in the Southwest, the Albuquerque volcanoes all formed simultaneously. This is because they all erupted from the same fissure eruption. The actual eruption probably took place over a period of months to years. To the south and west of Belen and Los Lunas there is another series of cinder cones called the Cat Hills volcanoes. These are slightly younger and consist of more typical cinders and agglomerate. Will they erupt again? Small volcanoes do not reactivate like big volcanoes, but the area around Albuquerque remains potentially active, mainly because of its location in the Rio Grande rift. A new volcano could erupt, if not along the Albuquerque Volcanoes, at least somewhere within the rift. One of the larger earthquake swarms in New Mexico occurred in 1972 beneath the volcanoes. There is no particular evidence that this was new magma moving up a crack. Instead, the earthquake swarm may have been re-adjustments of dikes and faults at great depth as the deeper portions of the dike continue to cool and contract. Many people visiting the volcanoes in the winter months have noticed "warm" air in the caves. This is probably not "volcanic heat", but instead is ambient air trapped in the subsurface that feels warm compared with the cold outside air. If one were to visit the same caves during the summer, one would find them cool compared with the outside air. The caves simply record the temperature of Albuquerque "averaged" over a year, which is around 55 degrees F, a temperature that feels warm in the winter and cool in the summer. How did they form? If you were to look down on the Albuquerque Volcanoes you would see that they are arranged in a nearly straight line. This also is apparent if you stand on top of one volcano and look across to the next one. This is simply because they erupted along a fracture in the crust. Fractures of this type along which eruptions take place are referred to as "fissure eruptions". Many of the eruptions in Hawaii are fissure eruptions in which the fissures frequently extend outward from summit craters or calderas. The fractures in Hawaii are thought to result from the gradual sliding of parts of the sides of the large volcanoes that make up the Hawaiian islands. Fissures also occur in Iceland where the crust is being pulled apart along the Mid Atlantic ridge. In New Mexico the fractures have an origin similar to those in Iceland. Here the fractures are part of the faults that formed where the crust has been pulled apart by forces similar to those in Iceland. The eruption that resulted in the Albuquerque Volcanoes probably looked similar to eruptions in Iceland. Although the Albuquerque Volcanoes appear to occur in a straight line, they are actually arranged in slightly offset segments like the fissure in this example from Iceland. This is probably a good analogy of what they looked like when they started erupting and before the eruptions centralized on several spots. Once the eruptions centralized on these spots, the cones that we see today began to build up. The stretching that helped create the Albuquerque Volcanoes has resulted in the development of the Rio Grande rift. The rift valleys of eastern Africa are another example of similar stretching and pulling apart of Earth's crust. The East African rift and the Rio Grande rift are two of the youngest and largest continental rifts currently active on Earth. This is probably one reason why East African and New Mexico are among the most geologically, and ecologically, interesting and exotic places on Earth. Fissure eruptions occur when conditions are right in the mantle for the existence of partially melted rock magma and faults act as conduits for the rise of magma to the surface. When a vertical crack filled with molten magma known as a "dike" intersects the surface, a line of eruption takes place. If the dike is particularly large and deep, the line of eruption or fissure is long, like the Albuquerque Volcanoes. Other dikes are smaller and the associated fissure eruptions at the surface are relatively short. Why are the Albuquerque Volcanoes important and unusual? Most of the scoria cones and volcanoes in New Mexico and throughout the Southwestern U.S. are the result of smaller fissure eruptions. This is one reason why the Albuquerque Volcanoes are so unusual and geologically interesting. They are an excellent example of fissure eruption. In addition, few large cities in the United States have such young basaltic volcanoes nearby within a few minutes drive of downtown that are also an important part of the metropolitan landscape. The Albuquerque Volcanoes are also an unusual type of scoria cone. Many scoria cones in the Southwest are piles of cinder. Examples are Capulin volcano, Bandera Crater, and Sunset Crater. Some of the Albuquerque Volcanoes like Vulcan, the largest cone, are cones formed from spatter and thin lava flows coating an interior of cinder. What are they made of? The Volcanoes are basalt, a type of lava that consists largely of the minerals plagioclase, olivine, pyroxene, and magnetite. There are two principal types of basaltic lava in the Southwest: alkali basalt and tholeiite, defined on the basis of the relative abundances of sodium and potassium. The Albuquerque Volcanoes are made of tholeiite that is low in sodium and especially potassium. These different types of lava reflect the differences in the depth and composition of the mantle rocks that were melted and erupted. By comparison, the youngest lava of El Malpais McCartys lava flow is tholeiite. Many of the volcanic fields, like Mount Taylor's collection of small volcanoes, also on the western horizon of Albuquerque, are alkali basalt SAN FELIPE VOLCANIC FIELD Location: 35 degrees  25' to 35 degrees  35'N, 106 degrees  25' to 106 degrees  35'W, Bernalillo County Type: Basaltic fissure eruptions & scoria/spatter cones Age: 2.5 ? 0.3 Ma Significance: Compact volcanic field; numerous fault scarps; classic shield volocano San Felipe volcano is a classic small shield volcano. It is in a compact volcanic field with numerous fault scarps that can be seen from the highway in Bernalillo. San Felipe volcano is a classic small shield volcano. Canjilon Hill from the air is a partially dissected twin steam-blast explosion crater maar and represents the southern margin of the San Felipe field. It is one of the more unusual levels of exposure of a maar in the Southwest Canjilon Hill as seen from the highway near Bernalillo. From this angle it appears as a simple mesa. But actually it is a conical structural depression on an elevated platform that developed by erosion on the margins of the Rio Grande VALLES CALDERA, JEMEZ VOLCANIC FIELD Location: Valles Caldera, 35 degrees  35' to 36 degrees  15' N, 106 degrees  10' to 106 degrees  48' W;, Sandoval County Type: Ash-flow caldera, viscous domes, basaltic flows Age: 14 Ma to 0.04 Ma Significance: One of the largest young calderas on Earth; type area for resurgent ash-flow calderas Composition: Rhyolite, dacite, some early basaltic eruptions When you drive or hike through the Jemez, you are looking at a landscape created by young volcanic eruptions. The Jemez Mountains are volcanic mountains; their landscape - every mountain, canyon and ridge - tells the story of their volcanic history.The Valles Caldera is about 12 miles 20 km in diameter. It is one of the largest young calderas on Earth and it is considered by geologists to be an active volcano. Jemez Mountain eruptions have continued intermittently from 14 million years ago to as recently as 40,000 years ago. The Valles Caldera was formed about 1 million years ago when multiple explosive eruptions occurred that produced an immense outpouring of ash, pumice, and pyroclastic flows. Summary When you drive or hike through the Jemez Mountains, you are looking at a landscape created by young volcanic eruptions. The Jemez Mountains are volcanic mountains; eruptions have continued intermittently from 14 million years ago to as recently as 40,000 years ago. The Valles Caldera is a supervolcano eruption, like Yellowstone, and one of the largest young calderas on Earth. It formed about 1 million years ago when multiple explosive eruptions occurred that produced an immense outpouring of ash, pumice, and pyroclastic flows. It is considered by geologists to be still active. Volcanic Field Volcanic fields differ from the more popular conception of volcanoes, like Hawaii or the large volcanoes of the Cascades. Instead of one big volcano, volcanic fields consist of clusters of many small volcanoes. Overall, they are all characterized by many small centers of eruption one to a few kilometers across of fundamentally basaltic, but ranging to more silica-rich, compositions. The Jemez Volcanic Field, however, is different in that it began 14 million years ago as a normal volcanic field with the eruption of many small volcanoes and then experienced at least two extremely explosive caldera eruption events. The most recent of which, approximately 1.2 million years ago, formed the Valles Caldera and resulted in the eruption of the Bandelier Tuff, a thick ash flow unit that covers almost all of the earlier volcanic rocks from the field. Valles Caldera A caldera eruption differs from other volcanic eruptions. This is not the type of eruption where the summit peak is blown off and a crater is formed in the top of a large volcano. Frequently asked questions: What is a caldera? A caldera forms when the ground collapses into the magma chamber as the magma is erupted in a series of explosive eruptions. Yellowstone and the Valles Caldera are similar and two of the best examples of young calderas in the world. How old is the Valles Caldera? The caldera formed by collapse in a series of eruptions from about 1.4 to 1.1 million years ago. But the geologic evolution of the caldera has continued to today. What type of volcanic rock has been erupted in the Jemez Mountains? Early eruptions consisted of basalt lava flows, ash, pumice and ash-flows. As the Valles Caldera formed, air-fall ash and pumice must have covered most of New Mexico, and neighboring states, and has been identified as far east as Kansas. Pyroclastic flows moving away from the caldera formed what is today known as the Pajarito Plateau, and the sites of Los Alamos and White Rock. After the caldera formed, later eruptions formed domes and flows of rhyolite and obsidian that occur in a ring within the caldera. What is an ash-flow or a pyroclastic-flow? Hot, rolling clouds of incandescent ash and rock fragments that flow along the ground. The word pyroclastic comes from the Greek for fire-rock. Pyroclastic flows move very rapidly and are so hot that they weld into solid rock as they slow. How high were the Jemez prior to the eruption? Probably not much higher than they are today. This is not the type of eruption where a summit peak is blown off. Is this a supervolcano? Yes. The term supervolcano has recently been used to describe a caldera eruption, but it is a little misleading; calderas occur when multiple volcanoes interact and erupt in a series of eruptions, not from a single volcano or in a single very large eruption. It should be noted that volcanologists currently use the term "super eruption" to describe an eruption of several hundred cubic kilometers. But there is no definition for a "supervolcano." Presumably the non-volcanologist can be excused for the time being at least if they wish to refer to a volcano that hosted a super eruption as a "supervolcano." Why is the Valles Caldera located here? The Jemez Mountains are located along the western margin faults of the Rio Grande rift and are associated with the volcanic activity of this youthful and still active continental rift. The entire mountain range was built by a long record of many volcanic eruptions. The Valles Caldera was formed when multiple and long-lasting magma bodies merged into a large magma chamber. Will the Valles Caldera erupt again? This type of volcanism has a slow tempo. Even though the caldera appears inactive because it is grown over with trees, it probably looked like that for most of its history. The presence of hot springs shows that the caldera is part of a large, long-lived, and still active system. General Summary: The Jemez Mountains and the Valles Caldera rifting in Jemez Mountains region began 16.5 Ma 13 to 10 Ma eruptions of basalt and rhyolite along Canada de Cochiti fault zone interbedded with basin-fill conglomerate and laharic breccias of Cochiti Formation between 10 and 7 Ma basalt and rhyolite erupted 1/2 the volume of the volcanic field 7 to 6 Ma eruptions of mixed magmas and sharp reduction in volcanic activity renewed basaltic activity at 4 Ma around margins and to east Cerros del Rio volcanic field Valles Caldera formed during eruption of Tshirege member at 1.12 Ma Bandelier Ash-flow Tuff erupted 1.2 Ma rhyolite composition 70 mi3 of Tshirege member Note: Mt.

At more than 20 km across the Valles Caldera is so large that you really need to be high above the surface to actually see the whole structure in one perspective view. This view, looking south, was taken from a small plane at an altitude of 14,000 feet above sea level The caldera is a result of collapse following the eruption of rhyolitic magmas from a large magma chamber. There was no large volcano prior to the collapse, just many volcanoes all clustered in the region. This is what makes giant calderas somewhat different than the type of volcanoes that most non-volcanologist have in mind when they think of a volcano. They are broad areas of intense volcanism rather than a single giant "volcanic mountain." The floor of the caldera was occupied by a lake shortly after the collapse event. But it was short-lived because the floor of the caldera bulged upwards over the next several tens of thousands to 100,000 years resulting in the large mountain in the center of the caldera, Redondo Peak. The floor bulged upwards when it rebounded, or "resurged",  after removal of the weight of all the erupted magma, and because new, relatively degassed magma gradually inflated the top of the magma chamber. It was at this time that a series of viscous lava domes were erupted around the central buldge. Bandelier Ashflow Tuff sitting on Permian red rocks Hydrothermal Activity in the Valles Caldera Although young and morphologically better developed than the Yellowstone caldera, hydrothermal activity in the Valles Caldera is limited.  This is due, in part, to the relatively dryer environment relative to Yellowstone. It is also a function of the slighter greater age of the Valles system. Numerical models of heat transfer by fluid convection around large rhyolite magma chambers shows that the rate of heat loss is great. Unless continued magma injections occur to replace the heat loss, the thermal system will decline. The Valles caldera has been cooling for about 1.1 Ma since the caldera-forming eruption, and 0.5 Ma since the last rhyolite dome eruptions inside the caldera. The following table summarizes the estimated thermal output of the three youngest, large ash-flow calderas in the continental Unites States. Caldera	Thermal Energy	Age Yellowstone, WY	5000 MW	0.6 Ma Long Valley, CA	180 MW	0.76 Ma Valles, NM	70 MW	1.1 Ma Summary of Thermal Activity Hydrothermal activity initiated about 1 Ma Concentrated on SW resurgent dome and western ring-fracture areas Mostly dilute groundwater heat by high-temperatures at shallow depths Result of convective circulation of water over deep,hot central caldera rocks Meteoric water recharges the system; 300 degrees C at depth of 2 to 3 km Convection in deep reservoir with vapor cap Liquid-dominated system at depth ascends convectively to 500 to 600 m depth Top of system is vapor capped by subsurface boiling at about 200 degrees C Heats shallow levels that are diluted with groundwater flowing laterally Springs are acid-sulfate waters Result from condensation of steam and oxidation of H2S to form sulfuric acid Mixes with near-surface groundwater flowing from northern and eastern moat basins - Water flows laterally from top of system down hydrologic gradient Thermal waters flow down gradient outside of ring fracture in San Diego Canyon Vapor cap formed after breaching of SW caldera margin by ancestral Jemez River Resulted in draining of intracaldera lakes Lowered hydraulic head resulted in drop of maximum elevation of liquid in reservoir Section through the southwest margin of the caldera. Hot water spills out of the caldera and flows down the hydrologic gradient. At certain locations, such as Soda Dam, the ground water iencounters a significant fault and follows the fault zone to the surface The popular Tent Rocks recreational trails area represents debris shed off some of the earliest eruptions from the Jemez Mountains. This is an aerial oblique view looking north. For context, the caldera is out of the view to the left west and the city of Santa Fe is out of the view too, but on the right. The tent rocks geomorphology is a result of rapid incision of the relatively soft volcanic tuff and volcanoclastic materials and perching of relatively resistant blocks of volcanic debris. Rapid incision occurs because, like most semi-arid locations, most of New Mexico's rain fall comes in brief burst during very limited times of the year. The run-off instead of run-in together with soft ash and silt encourages local gullying, which further encourages localized gully incision in the same location. Hence, deep incision and little back-wasting occurs without much weathering and rounding of the landforms. TUSAS-BRAZOS EL ALTO VOLCANIC FIELD Location: 36 degrees  30' to 36 degrees  45'N, 106 degrees  18' to 106 degrees  38' W, Rio Arriba County Type: Four scoria cones and associated basaltic lava flows. Age: Late Pleistocene Significance: Unusual location on summit of Tusas Mountains; flows from the twin Brazos cones flowed several thousand feet down in elevation along the Brazos Box to the lower elevations at Tierra Amarilla. Composition: Basalt Unusual location on summit of Tusas Mountains; flows from the twin Brazos cones flowed several thousand feet down in elevation along the Brazos Box to the lower elevations at Tierra Amarilla. Location of the principal vents and lava flows of the Brazos field in relation to the Taos Plateau field. The field is located between Chama and Tres Piedras. Lava flows from the Brazos cones are exposed south of Chama in a road cut TAOS PLATEAU VOLCANIC FIELD Location: 36 degrees  36' N latitude, 105 degrees  48' W longitude, Taos County Type: Tholeiitic sheet flows, scoria/spatter cones, and silicic shield volcanoes and domes Age: ~4 million to 1.8 million years area includes some 22 million year old vents Significance: Largest volcanic field within the Rio Grande rift and unusual silicic shield volcanoes The Taos Volcanic Field is the largest volcanic field within the Rio Grande Rift. It is petrologically and volcanologically diverse, including compositions from tholeiite to rhyolite, and vent morphologies from cinder cones to steep-sided domical volcanoes. The field covers over 7,000 km2 and shares the broad valley floor with the Rio Grande which cuts through extensive sheets of thicks lavas, the Serviellta basalts, to form the Rio Grande Gorge. It is bounded on the east side by the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and on the west by the Tusas Mountains. On the north it terminates near the Colorado border and on the south squeezes into the narrow constriction between the Taos basin and the Espanola basin. The Taos Plateau Volcanic Field is the largest volcanic field within the Rio Grande rift. The field fills the entire Taos basin of the rift, which is bounded on the east side by the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and on the west by the Tusas Mountains. It is unusual for the number of steep-sided volcanic domes and shield volcanoes that are included within the field. The volcanic edifices and lava flows have filled the basin and created a broad valley. Over the past several million years, the Rio Grande has cut down through the extensive layers of lava flows, named the Servilleta basalts, that fill the basin. The river cutting through these layers has formed the Rio Grande Gorge. Volcanic fields differ from the more popular conception of volcanoes, like Hawaii or the large volcanoes of the Cascades. Instead of one big volcano, volcanic fields consist of clusters of many small volcanoes. Overall, they are all characterized by many small centers of eruption one to a few kilometers across of fundamentally basaltic, but ranging to more silicic, compositions. Thousands of years may occur between the eruption of each small volcano, but they all occur within the space of a hundred kilometers or so, and contain from several tens of vents to several hundred volcanic vents erupted over a period of several million years. At any one time during the field's active lifetime, this means that it probably looked much as it does today. Each volcano is characterized by low rates of magma eruption and dark lava flows. The Taos Volcanic Field predominantly consists of steep-sided domical and shield-type volcanoes along with abundant lava flows, although there are some cinder cones. The Taos Volcanic Field is the largest volcanic field within the Rio Grande rift. It is diverse, both petrologically rock type and volcanologically volcanic edifice, including rock compositions from tholeiite to rhyolite and vent morphologies volcano type ranging from cinder cones to steep-sided domical volcanoes to shield volcanoes. The field covers over 7,000 km2 and has formed the broad valley floor by filling the rift basin with volcanic lava flows. The Rio Grande cuts through the extensive sheets of thick lavas, the Servilleta basalts, to form the Rio Grande Gorge. The rift basin and the field within it are bounded on the east side by the Sangre de Cristo Mountains and on the west by the Tusas Mountains. On the north the field extends to near the Colorado border and on the south it ends within the narrow constriction between the Taos basin and the Espanola basin. Two lava flow units exposed in a road cut on the north side of highway 285 near San Antonio volcano. This road cut exposes a lower lava flow resting on baked ash. A long period of erosion after the eruption of the lower lava flow resulted in soil development on top of this lava flow and created a significant unconformity a leap in time between the lower and upper lava flows. The upper lava flow is interpreted to be a xenocrystic containing large mineral crystals picked up from other rocks basalt dated at 2.4 Ma million years old. The lower lava flow is interpreted to be the 3.82 Ma Servilleta basalt part of the basalt sequence cut by the Rio Grande to form the gorge. If these identifications are correct, then nearly 1.5 million years separated the eruption of the two flows. The classic "artist view" of the Taos Gorge. The hills in the distance are individual volcanoes of the Taos Plateau field. The Rio Grande Gorge is frequently confused with the Rio Grande rift. The rift is the entire valley filled with volcanoes and volcanic lava flows. The gorge is a feature within the rift. It was formed by the river cutting down through the basalt flows that filled the rift. OCAT� VOLCANIC FIELD Location: 35 degrees  40' N to 36 degrees  20' , 104 degrees  40' W to 105 degrees  12' W, Mora County Type: Volcanic field consisting of scoria cones, shield volcano, and lava flows Age: Pliocene to Pleistocene, 8.3 to 0.8 Ma Significance: Volcanic field at the foot of the east slopes of the Sangre de Cristo Rocky Mountains and Fort Union and Santa Fe trail Composition: alkali basalt, andesite, and dacite The Ocate Volcanic Field consists of at least 16 flows and about 50 associated vents ranging in age from 8.34-0.50 Ma to 0.81-0.14 Ma. Like the RCVF, three major topographic levels of lava flows relate to three age groups: older than 5 Ma, which includes flows capping mesas with surfaces around 3000m in elevation and an apparent E-W fissure line of vents near Wagon Mound;  5-4 Ma, which includes most of the flows around Agua Fria; and  younger than 4 Ma, which includes the most abundant flows in the OVF and such vents as Cerrito Pelon, Cerro Negro, Cerro del Oro and Maxon Crater. Maxon crater consists of a large cluster of scoria cones defining the summit substantial shield volcano which Interstate 25 crosses between Watrous and Springer. Flows from Maxon crater flowed 90 km eastward along the canyon cut by the Mora River. Remnants of these flows occur 100 m below the rim of the canyon and 125m above the present level of the river. The youngest flows in the field were erupted from Cerro del Oro, in the central part of Charette Mesa, northwest of Wagon Mound. The Ocat� volcanic field OVF extends from Agua Fria Peak to Wagon Mound, NM. It consists of about 50 individual volcanoes, and associated lava flows, ranging in age from approximately 8 million years to 800,000 years old. Maxon Crater and Wagon Mound are two of the volcanic features of this field that are readily seen by travelers on I-25, although the travelers may not realize they are looking at volcanic eruptions. Those who ski at Angel Fire may not realize that they are just to the east of Agua Fria Peak, one of the westernmost of the Ocat� volcanoes. Agua Fria is a shield-type volcano; the same type that has built the Hawaiian Islands. Agua Fria erupted about 5 million years ago. Geological Overview Volcanic Field Volcanic fields differ from the more popular conception of volcanoes, like Hawaii or the large volcanoes of the Cascades. Instead of one big volcano, volcanic fields consist of clusters of many small volcanoes. Overall, they are all characterized by many small centers of eruption one to a few kilometers across of fundamentally basaltic, but ranging to more silicic, compositions. Thousands of years may occur between the eruption of each small volcano, but they all occur within the space of a hundred kilometers or so, and contain from several tens of vents to several hundred volcanic vents erupted over a period of several million years. At any one time during the field's active lifetime, this means that it probably looked much as it does today. Each volcano is characterized by low rates of magma eruption and consists mainly of cinders, spatters, and dark lava flows, although other types are present in many fields. In the OVF, many of the volcanoes are shield volcanoes, such as Aspen Hillm Apache Peak, Agua Fria Peak, and Maxon Crater; although there are also some intermidate-age composite or stratovolcanoes, such as Cerro Montoso. The Ocat� volcanic field OVF, sometimes called the Mora volcanic field, is located at the boundary between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains physiographic provinces, and lies on the east flank of the Rio Grande rift. The field consists of at least 16 basaltic to dacitic lava flows and about 50 associated vents ranging in age from late Miocene to Pleistocene, 8.34�0.50 Ma to 0.81�0.14 Ma. Like the nearby Raton-Clayton Volcanic Field RCVF, three major topographic levels of lava flows in the Ocat� field relate to three age groups. These are defined in part by a sequence of "inverted topographic valleys" in which the older eruptions are situated on earlier and now higher erosion surfaces, and subsequent eruptions were emplaced on younger, eroded lower surfaces and in modern drainages. The three volcanic eruption age groups are:  volcanism older than 5 Ma million years, which includes flows capping mesas with surfaces around 3000 m in elevation and an apparent E-W fissure line of vents near Wagon Mound;  volcanism between 5-4 Ma, which includes most of the flows in the northern part of the field and around Agua Fria Peak as well as other shield volcanoes; and  volcanism younger than 4 Ma, which includes the most abundant flows in the OVF and volcanic vents edifices such as Cerrito Pelon, Cerro Negro, Cerro del Oro and Maxon Crater. The youngest flows in the field were erupted from the multiple Cerro del Oro scoria cone vents in the central part of Charette Mesa, northwest of Wagon Mound. The OVF is bounded by the southern part of the Cimarron Range of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains on the north, and extends to the general vicinity of Wagon Mound, NM. The ridge called Wagon Mound consists of an elongate thick basaltic lava and tuff breccia section striking along a an apparent E-W fissure line that includes volcanic vents on Jarosa and Santa Clara Mesas west of I-25 amd Las Mesas del Conjelon, east of I-25. The calc-alkalic to tholeiitic basaltic flows have been dated at 5.9 Ma million years. The Wagon Mound volcanic section once filled a valley, but it is now a mesa created by the erosion of the softer surrounding sedimentary rock.  Geologically, this is called "inverted topography."  Continued erosion has shaped Wagon Mound to resemble the profile of a conestoga wagon; and it was a prominent feature and trail marker for travelers along the Santa Fe Trail. Agua Fria Peak is a shield-type volcano; the same type that has built the Hawaiian Islands. Shield volcanoes are built up slowly by lava flow after lava flow erupting in a radial pattern. The lava flows in and around Agua Fria Peak are intermediate in age, between 5 and 4 million years, and are olivine basalts. Maxon crater is noticeable to travelers on I-25, between Watrous and Springer, as the site of a roadside rest area; but most travelers probably have no idea that they are driving across the flank of a large basaltic shield volcano; the same type of volcano that created the Hawaiian Islands. Maxon consists of a large cluster of scoria cones at the summit of this substantial shield volcano. Maxon is included in the youngest age group in the field, and has been dated at 1.4 million years old. Basaltic lava flows from Maxon crater flowed 90 km eastward down the canyon cut by the Mora River. Remnants of these flows occur 100 m below the rim of the canyon and 125 m above the present level of the river. Cerrito Pelon volcanic center as seen from Fort Union National Monument. The soldiers who were assigned to Fort Union probably did not realize that they were surrounded by volcanoes and volcanic lava flows. Wagon Mound viewed from the outskirts of the small town of the same name. The structure consists of an elongate thick basaltic lava and tuff breccia section striking along a local fissure line. Wagon Mound was named due to its shape resembling the profile of a conestoga wagon; it was a prominent feature and trail marker along the Santa Fe Trail RATON-CLAYTON VOLCANIC FIELD: CAPULIN VOLCANO Location: 36 to 37.3 degrees  N latitude, 103.1 to 104.3 degrees  W longitude, Union County Type: Extensive volcanic field of scoria cones, silicic volcanoes, and lava flows Age: 9 million years to 40,000 years Significance: Large and young monogenetic scoria cones; extreme diversity of lava compositions from very mafic to dacitic The Raton-Clayton field is one of the best examples of a large volcanic field in the world. Volcanic fields differ from the more popular conception of volcanoes, like Hawaii or Mount St. Helens. Instead of one big volcano, volcanic fields are clusters of many small volcanoes up to 2 miles across. Volcanic fields are usually 60 or more miles across, and contain tens to several hundred separate volcanoes. Each volcano consists mainly of cinders, spatters, and dark lava flows. The volcanoes do not all form at the same time. Instead, several thousand years may pass between the eruption and formation of each volcano. Volcanic fields represent many eruptions spaced out over a period of several million years. Summary The Raton-Clayton volcanic field RCVF is a large, young volcanic field covering nearly 7500 square miles of northeastern New Mexico and adjoining Colorado and Oklahoma. It is the eastern-most young volcanic field in North America. The best-known feature is Capulin volcano, a classic cinder cone volcano that is a National Monument. Capulin was once believed to be as young as 11,000 years old; however, recent geological studies have dated it at 56,000 to 62,000 years. Capulin Mountain is similar in size and morphology to Paricutin volcano, Mexico which erupted in 1943.The RCVF contains well-preserved wheel ruts of the Santa Fe trail and some of the volcanoes were used as markers on the trail. Volcanic fields differ from the more popular conception of volcanoes, like Hawaii or the large volcanoes of the Cascades. Instead of one big volcano, volcanic fields consist of clusters of many small volcanoes. Overall, they are all characterized by many small centers of eruption one to a few kilometers across of fundamentally basaltic, but ranging to more silicic, compositions. Thousands of years may occur between the eruption of each small volcano, but they all occur within the space of a hundred kilometers or so, and contain from several tens of vents to several hundred volcanic vents erupted over a period of several million years. At any one time during the field's active lifetime, this means that it probably looked much as it does today. Each volcano is characterized by low rates of magma eruption and consists mainly of cinders, spatters, and dark lava flows, although other types are present in many fields. The RCVF is mostly small scoria cones and associated lava flows, but there are a few large lava cones, such as Sierra Grande. Raton-Clayton Volcanic Field The Raton-Clayton Volcanic Field RCVF is an example of a large volcanic field. The field covers nearly 7500 square miles of northeastern New Mexico and adjoining Colorado and Oklahoma. The distinctive characteristic of the Raton-Clayton field is its great size, young age, continental interior setting, and possible association with one of the few volcanic hot spots in the world. If you start traveling east, you would not encounter volcanic rocks this young again until the mid-Atlantic ridge. The lava compositions are also somewhat unusual. And it is the site of Capulin volcano, the easternmost young, and easily accessible, volcano in all of North America. The Raton-Clayton volcanic field is best known to historians as the site of some of the best preserved segments of the Santa Fe trail. Famous landmarks on the trail such as Round Mound, Wagon Mound, and Rabbit Ears Mountains are all volcanic eruption centers. Geographically, the field lies at the northeastern end of what has been called the Jemez lineament." This alignment of volcanic fields extends from the Pinacate field of Mexico through the Springerville Volcanic Field in eastern Arizona, through the Zuni-Bandera Volcanic Field and the Mount Taylor Volcanic Field near Grants, New Mexico, through the Jemez Volcanic Field and the Cerros del Rio Volcanic Field near Santa Fe, and terminating in the northeastern corner of New Mexico in the Raton-Clayton field. Some studies also include the Taos volcanic field as part of the general trend as well. In fact, the Taos field bears many similarities with the Raton-Clayton field in terms of age, morphology of silicic vents, and compositions. Because the alignment of fields in the Jemez lineament is parallel to the Snake River-Yellowstone volcanic hot spot track, the Jemez Lineament has been considered by some volcanologists to be a type of volcanic hot spot. Hot spots are rare, unlike the very common and explosive type of volcanoes like Mount St. Helens. Only 49 volcanic hot spots are recognized by volcanologists in the world. A few other famous volcanic hot spots include the Azores, Reunion Island, Iceland, Hawaii, and parts of East Africa. However, there is no age-progression sequence in the eruption of these fields from southwest to northeast and no strong volcanic association in the chemistry or rock-types of all of the fields. Recent research suggests that the alignment is due to preferred eruption of volcanism along an ancient precambrian suture line in the crust, rather than movement of the North American plate over a hot spot in this location. The oldest rocks range from about 9 million years old, and the youngest erupted as recently as 45,000 years ago. The earliest lavas of the Raton-Clayton field flowed onto the surface of sediment that was eroded from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. Continued uplift of the general land surface during eruption resulted in the erosion of this surface where it was not capped by volcanic rocks. During subsequent eruptions, lava flowed down valleys cut between the lava capped areas. The result is a series of inverted topographic valleys such that the oldest volcanic rocks are now found at the highest elevations above present erosional levels, with younger lavas at progressively lower levels. The most recent volcanic activity occurred at several volcanoes in the center of the field in the vicinity of Capulin Mountain, where lava flows have moved down current drainages. The Raton-Clayton volcanic field is the easternmost Cenozoic volcanic field in the United States. To the east, Cenozoic volcanic rocks are not encountered at this latitude again until the mid-Atlantic ridge.  As an interesting note, the town of Clayton publicizes the nearby occurrence of Cretaceous-age dinosaur tracks in the sedimentary rocks exposed at Clayton Lake State Park, yet ironically makes no mention of its location near the eastern edge of the easternmost, young, and one of the largest, volcanic fields in the North American continen Capulin Volcano The youngest volcanic activity occurred in the center of the field in the vicinity of Capulin Volcano, the eastern-most young volcano in the United States. Recent work by geologists from the College of Santa Fe, Northern Arizona University, and the Park Service, yielded age dates showing that Capulin volcano erupted approximately 56,000 to 62,000 years ago, somewhat older than the initially reported age of ~11,000 years ago. This younger age was based on an assumption that Capulin lava flows were the same age as the nearby Folsom Culture paleosite. Age determinations based on new techniques have now given us more accurate data on Capulin lava flows. Capulin Mountain is a classic cinder cone with associated small volumes of lava flows. It is similar in size and morphology, and probably eruptive characteristics, to Paricutin volcano, Mexico which erupted in 1943. A detailed study of Capulin, indicates that a complicated series of lava flows and cinder/spatter eruptions occurred, during or after the eruption of the cinder cone, in order to build Capulin volcano. Lava flows traveled down what are essentially modern drainages. Three major series of lava flow units occurred, the earliest flowed to the east-southeast of the cone, the second to the west and south, and the third to the west and north. The second and third series of flows erupted from an area at the base of the cone called the boca mouth and during these eruptions several intermittent lava lakes formed at the lower flanks of the volcano and portions of the cone were "rafted" away on the surface of the flows. The similarity between Capulin and Paricutin volcanoes is striking. In addition to the size and general morphology of the cones, both cones developed large bocas or flows that emerge from one flank, ramp down from the cone flanks in approximately the same way, and spread lava flows in much the same way. A large lava channel on the Paricutin boca is similar to the channel that today is the picnic area at Capulin. However, Capulin Volcano National Monument was created decades before Paricutin erupted. Paricutin erupted in a Mexican farmer�s cornfield in 1943, approximately 60,000 years after Capulin. Additional Information about the Raton-Clayton field The Raton-Clayton field is elongated northwest-southeast, the axis extending from near Trinidad, Colorado to 140 km southeastward near Clayton, New Mexico Including the outlying parts, the field covers nearly 20,000 km2. The oldest rocks range from about 9 Ma and the youngest erupted less than 60,000 years ago. The distinctive characteristic of the Raton-Clayton field is the presence of highly alkalic mafic lavas with SiO2 contents as low as 36%. However, the field also contains centers, such as Sierra Grande, that erupted andesite, dacite or rhyodacite up to nearly 70% SiO2. Phases of Volcanic Activity Stratigraphy in the Raton-Clayton Volcanic Field Traditionally the RCVF has been divided into three main phases of volcanic activity. As a result of recent age radiometric determinations , the ages of these phases are now known to be older than reported in earlier published accounts. Nonetheless, the basic stratigraphy remains adequately defined by three periods. Raton Phase 9.0 - 3.5 Ma Clayton Phase 3.0 -2.25 Ma Capulin Phase 1.7 - 0.04 Ma These are defined in part by a sequence of inverted topography in which the older units are situated on earlier and now higher erosion surfaces, and subsequent eruptions were emplaced on younger and lower surfaces.The earliest lavas of the Raton-Clayton field flowed onto the surface of an alluvial apron of sediment shed eastward from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains which are located to the west of the field . Continuing uplift during eruption resulted in the erosion of this surface where it was not capped by volcanic rocks. During subsequent eruptions, lava flowed down valleys cut into this surface. The result is a series of "inverted topographic valleys" such that the oldest volcanic rocks are generally found at the highest elevations above present erosional levels, with younger lavas at progressively lower levels and in modern drainages. The rate of downcutting has been significantly greater in the western part of the field along the head of valleys draining into the Canadian River. The high, lava-capped mesas in the distance to the north are over 700 m above the valley floor. To the east, the elevation of the older basalt-capped mesas decreases, and at Clayton they are only a few meters above the present valley floors. CARRIZOZO LAVA FLOW FIELD Location: 33 degrees  20' N to 33 degrees  53' N, 106 degrees  W, Lincoln County Type: Basaltic lava flow Age: Holocene, ~5,000 years Significance: One of the largest volume young morphologically preserved lava flows on Earth Composition: Between alkalic and tholeiitic basalt The Carrizozo flow is 75 km long from the vent area to the distal margin in the Tularosa Valley . The entire flow covers ~330 km2 to an estimated thickness of 10 to 15 m, for a total erupted volume of ~4.3 km3. The lava is intermediate in composition between alkalic and tholeiitic basalt and is consistent with the regional volcanism associated with the Rio Grande rift . Various researchers  have distinguished between upper and lower Carrizozo flow units, separated by a narrow ?neck? in the medial reach. However, chemical analyses to date have revealed no evidence for distinct differences between the upper and lower lavas. Cosmogenic isotopic changes induced by exposure to high energy particles studies indicate exposure ages of 4800 yrs  to 5200 yrs for the Carrizozo flow, well within the 1700 and 700 yr error estimates, respectively. These results make the Carrizozo flow the second youngest volcanism in New Mexico, after only the McCartys flow. The Carrizozo flow field is 75 km long from the vent area to the distal margin in the Tularosa Valley. The entire flow covers ~330 km2 to an estimated thickness of 10 to 15 m, for a total estimated erupted volume of ~4.3 km3. The lava is intermediate in composition between alkalic and tholeiitic basalt. Its location and age is consistent with the regional volcanism elsewhere that is fundamentally associated with the Rio Grande rift. Various researchers have distinguished between upper and lower Carrizozo flow units, separated by a narrow neck in the medial reach. However, chemical analyses to date have revealed no evidence for distinct differences between the upper and lower lavas. Cosmogenic isotopic changes induced by exposure to high energy particles studies indicate exposure ages of 4800 yrs Anthony et al., 1998 to 5200 yrs for the Carrizozo flow field. These results make the Carrizozo flow field the second youngest volcanism in New Mexico, after only the McCartys flow field in western New Mexico. The vent area for the Carrizozo lava flow field, Little Black Peak. As with the vent area of the McCartys lava flow in El Malpais, the vent cone of the Carrizozo lava flow represents the last activity at the location from which most of the lava flows were erupted. The last material probably was gas-rich and lava-volume-poor. So the last material erupted was more pyroclastic. A few skylights occur in lava tubes along the traverse from the margins of the flow to the vent area The Carrizozo lava flow field extends from its source a few kilometers north of the current Highway 380 southward to the extreme northern end of White Sands. Most of the flow south of Highway 380 lies within the White Sands Missle Range. It appears to be one giant flow, but the flow field really consists of multiple small lobes of lava that flowed side by side down the floor of the valley. As a result the surface of the lava flow where the highway crosees actually slopes up to the west. In other words, each flow stacked against previous flows on the slopes on the valley floor and stair-step their way up slope. A few miles east of the vent for the Carrizozo lava flow field is a small area of older lava flows that are generally included in any discussion of recent volcanism in this area. Two scoria cones occupy the source area, Broken Back Craters. This is  a view from the highway looking approximately northwest toward the main cone. SIERRA BLANCA VOLCANO - CAPITAN -CARRIZO INTRUSIONS Location: 33.4 degrees  N latitude, 105.7 degrees  W longitude, Otero County Type: Massive complex of intermediate and silicic volcanic rocks intruded into pyroclastic materials, lava flows, and debris Age: Original volcano, 38 million years. Later intrusions, including Sierra Blanca peak, ~26 million Significance: Largest mid-Tertiary volcanic complex east of Rio Grande; eastern-most mountain of the Basin and Range Province; southern-most U. S. volcanic complex that towers into the Arctic/Alpine life zone. Location: 33.4? N latitude, 105.7? W longitude, Otero County Type: Massive complex of intermediate and silicic volcanic rocks intruded into pyroclastic materials, lava flows, and debris Age: Original volcano, 38 million years; later intrusions, including Sierra Blanca peak, ~26 million Significance: Largest mid-Tertiary volcanic complex east of Rio Grande; eastern-most mountain of the Basin and Range Province; southern-most U. S. volcanic complex that towers into the Arctic/Alpine life zone. Sierra is an older volcano consisting of intrusive stocks and dikes and contemporaneous ash, breccia, and flows. It is not a modern volcano like Mount Taylor or the Valles Caldera, but is an old one that has been greatly eroded. Based on the attitude of existing volcanic units the bulk volcano may have been originally on the order of 3000 ft above the surrrounding terrain, 20 miles in diameter and contained about 185 cubic miles of volcanic material. Estimates of the age of the initial volcano is 38 to 26 million years. This means that it erupted at about the same time that the volcanoes of the Gila and Mogollon Ranges in western New Mexico were erupting.There was considerable volcanism in the Southwest during this interval of time, most of which just preceded the formation of the Basin and Range Province. Volcanism of this age is often referred to as "mid-Tertiary" volcanism, which in the lingo of southwestern volcanology means "old". It is a testament to the original great size of the volcano, together with later block-faulting that it remains as a significant mountain even today. Chronology of Construction Volcanism began in Eocene time with intrusion of viscous alkalic magmas that domed pre-existing strata to form the northeast-trending, doubly plunging Black Mountain anticine. Emplacement of alkali gabbro and monzogabbto dikes in late Eocene time resulted in numerous shallow intrusions that fan out from the complex over much of the surrrounding terrain and account for numerous dikes in road cuts along highway 380 near Lincoln. Nearly 200 dikes may be counted along the road in a distance of 10 miles. The intensity of the intrusions is such that dilation of the region may have been as much as 0.5 miles. Folding of rocks observed near Lincoln may be related to emplacement of these intrusive masses. Following a half-million year interval of erosion that left a lowland along the axial trough, eruptions began to form the Sierra Blanca volcanic pile. Erupted rocks consist mostly of intermediate trachytic syenitic, basaltic, alkali-calcic andesite, monzonite, and locally rhyoltic compositions. The volcano itself developed between 38 Ma and 26 Ma with the eruption of a series of volcanoclastic materials, trachybasalt flows, trachyte and phonotephrite flows, and trachyphonolite flow breccias. The whole mass was intruded much later 26 million years ago by numerous dikes and sills, and finally by 16 large igneous dominantly syenite and monzonite stocks. Allen and Kottlowski 1981 show that the the age progression is from north to south at about 2.5 inches per year. Sierra Blanca Peak is itself one of these stocks, as is the Capitan Mountains to the north. The estimated thickness of the volcanic pile following main cone construction is 2500 m. Most of the volcanic materials are concentric to a core of intrusive rocks, possibly filling an arcuate depression interpreted as a central sag. Subsequent erosion has removed hundreds of cubic kilometers of rock from the volcano, precursor stocks, and Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata of the surrounding areas.The current elevation and shape is largely due to fault block uplift and erosion, including glaciation in the Pleistocene past two million years.The summit of Sierra Blanca is an intrusive stock. Sierra Blanca is said to be the eastern-most mountain associated with the Basin and Range Province, and the southern-most mountain in the U.S. with relief that extends upward into the Arctic-Alpine life zone. BOOTHEEL VOLCANIC FIELD Location: 31 degrees  20' to 32 degrees  20' N, 107 degrees  50' to 109 degrees  +' W, Hidalgo County Age: 35 Ma to 27 Ma Significance: Collection of old calderas in extreme southwestern New Mexico Composition: Rhyolite, andesite Location: 31? 20' to 32? 20' N, 107? 50' to 109? +' W, Hidalgo County Age: 35 Ma to 27 Ma Significance: Collection of old calderas in extreme southwestern New Mexico Composition: Rhyolite, andesite These calderas are part of the widespread volcanism that swept the Southwest during the Miocene. Like the Datil-Mogollon field to the immediate north, these have been broken up as part of the Basin and Range faulting and deeply dissected. Nonetheless, the centers of volcanism, and the fault-encircled extremely thick sections of outflow materials such as ash-flow tuffs and thick viscous lavas are evidence for the locations of the original calderas. PALOMAS VOLCANIC FIELD Location: 32 degrees  N, 108 degrees W, Luna County Age: < 5 Mil yrs Location: 32? N, 108?W, Luna County Age: < 5 Mil yrs Rocks in the Palomas volcanic field consist primarily of olivine basalt and associatedifferentiates of andesite and trachyte. The field is located on the western flank of the Rio Grande rift and displays a number of differences when compared to olivine basalt occurrences previously investigated within the rift in southern New Mexico. These differences include: l an older age compared to the rift basalts, 2 the occurrence of more highly differentiated members, and 3 the occurrence of a number of interesting volcanic features, including "pillow" basalt structures, basalt dikes, and lava-capped cinder cones LavR nlows-Olivine-rich basalt flows are the most dominant features in the field. They are moderate to highly weathered and have a partial mantle of eolian sand. The flows range in thickness from I to 40 ft, but average approximately l0 ft. They range from highly vesicular to extremely dense POTRILLO VOLCANIC FIELD Location: 31 degrees  45' to 32 degrees  15' N, 106 degrees  47' to 107 degrees  21' W, Dona Ana County Type: Scoria cones, shield volcanos, and maars Age: ~900 ka to ~20 ka Significance: Youthful volcanic field in Basin and Range setting; several youthful maars and cinder cones Composition: Alkali basalt and basanite The Potrillo  Volcanic Field  is one of the youngest and mostly southerly fields in New Mexico. The young ~0-24 ka eastern part of the field Aden-Afton field  consists of several scoria cones, a shield volcano, and maars, as well as some much older basaltic masses such as Black Mountain.  Three well-known maars, Hunt's Hole and Kilbourne Hole, and Potrillo, and a tuff cone, Riley occur in the eastern half of this field. The age of Kilbourne Hole is estimated at 80 ka, or approximately similar to Zuni salt Lake, another maar in northern and western New Mexico. Kilbourne Hole is widely known for its abundant mantle-lower crustal  xenoliths, but is better known in the volcanological community for its rim consisting of deposits emplaced through classic hydromagmatic base-surge eruptions, of which there are many excellent exposures. The western part of the field consists of more than a hundred basaltic scoria cones and is slighly older Aden Crater  and surrounding lava flow field. This is a relatively young eruption ~20-24 ka. The vent area left or west margin of dark flow field area is a shield volcano with a central platform and an extensive field of surrounding la a flows. The size and shape is typical of several other oate Cenozoic shield volcaneos and large lava flow fields in New Mexico. For example, see the decsription and images from the Jornada del Muerto field. Maxim Crater, El Tintero, Cerro Verde, or San Felip� The Potrillo volcanic field covers approximately 4,600 square kilometers 1,800 sq mi of Dona Ana County. It is a monogenetic volcanic field that can be divided in three volcanic regions. The westernmost West Potrillo Field consists of more than 100 cinder cones, two maar volcanoes and associated flows that covers approximately 1,250 square kilometers 480 sq mi. The central Aden�Afton field has a number of young flows, three cinder cones and three maar volcanoes, including Kilbourne Hole. Aden-Afton Field is approximately 230 square kilometers 89 sq mi in extent. The easternmost Black Mountain-Sao Thomas alignment is a north-south belt of vents near the Rio Grande that includes Santo Tomas, San Miguel, Little Clack Mountain and Black Mountain. The field consists almost entirely of alkaline olivine basalt. Most of the eastern area vents are scoria cones, some of which have breach flows with pahoehoe surface. Lavas of Black Mountain have been dated as 69 to 85 thousand years old. When performing 3He surface exposure dating, the upper 3 centimetres 1.2 in of flow surfaces is sufficient enough for collecting samples desired. It is essential to collect samples with primarily display flow features, such as spatter, flow lineation, and cooling rinds. The central Aden-Afton field includes Aden, Afton, the Gardner cones, and the Kilbourne Hole and Hunt's Hole maars. The two maars erupted through portions of pre-existing Afton series basalt flows. The Afton flows may have erupted through a fissure upon which the Gardner cones were emplaced. Aden is a well-preserved shield volcano that at one time had a lava lake, which later solidified and partially collapsed to the west. Its lavas have been dated as between 15 and 19 thousand years old. The western West Potrillo field includes the Western Potrillo Mountains, a cavalcade of hundreds of coalescing cones and flows formed upon older, thick platform that is possibly fissure-fed stacked flows. Also within the western area are the Riley, Malpais, and Potrillo maars. Potrillo maar is included with the western alignment due to its position west of the Robledo fault. The West Potrillo field is the oldest of the Potrillo volcanic fields, with lavas ranging in age from 262 to 916 thousand years. Kilbourne Hole maar, created about 24,000 years ago when magma rising from deep within the Earth encountered groundwater, blowing out an irregularly shaped hole more than a mile across, 1.7 miles long, and hundreds of feet deep. The central and eastern parts of the Potrillo volcanic field were erupted onto the La Mesa surface, which formed between 900 and 700 Ka. There is a diversity of rock types beneath the Potrillo volcanics, ranging in age from Proterozoic granites through a Phanerozoic sedimentary succession to basalt-andesite volcanics of the southern fringes of the Sierra de las Uvas volcanic field. One of the lava tubes of Aden Crater contained a ground sloth skeleton, which has been dated at about 11,000 years old. This is now at Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History. This ground sloth Nothrotheriops shastense is one of the few specimens of this age which have been found with patches of skin and hair preserved. The Potrillo volcanic field has two important xenolith localities. These are Kilbourne Hole and Potrillo maar where mantle peridotites, feldspathic granulites and kaersutite occur. Rock samples collected in the northern part of the pyroclastic deposit of the Potrillo maar, and lava associated with a cinder cone yielded potassium�argon ages of approximately 1.29 and 1.18 million years.
