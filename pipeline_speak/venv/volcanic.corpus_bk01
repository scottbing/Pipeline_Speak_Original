 ALBUQUERQUE VOLCANOES Location: 35.2° N, 106.8° W, Bernalillo County Type: Basaltic fissure eruptions & scoria/spatter cones Age: 190,000 to 220,000 years before present Significance: Young example of a long basaltic fissure eruption, many small volcanologic details preserved and within a few minutes drive of Albuquerque Composition: tholeiitic basalt and smal scoria-spatter cones aligned along fissure   Geological Overview The Rio Grande rift is segmented into a series of basins; the Albuquerque basin being one of them. It is bounded on the north by the La Bajada fault, which defines the southern margin of the Española basin, and to the south by the Socorro constriction.  Volcanism is distributed throughout the ABQ basin and the Albuquerque volcanoes are only one among several young volcanic features near Albuquerque.  Although most of these volcanic areas consist of dark, relatively low silica, and relatively fluid basalt lava flow and scoria eruptions, andesitic and more silicic compositions are represented in some of the volcanic centers, especially at depth within the rift valley basin fill. This means that although volcanism appears to be minor and only manifests itself in a few places in the current rift valley floor, there has been much more  volcanism within the Albuquerque basin segment of the Rio Grande rift over the past several million years and it is simply buried in the sediments filling the rift. We only see some of  the last erutive activity.  From most locations in Albuquerque there are several shield volcanoes visible to the north and south in addition to the Albuquerque volcanoes. Many of the mountains visible from Albuquerque, such as the Jemez Mountains to the north and Mount Taylor to the west are relatively young (meaning, still morphologically preserved) volcanoes.

Crumpler  The Albuquerque Volcanoes exhibit many unique volcanic features and you can see them on a short hike if you know where to look. For example, at the largest cone, ""Vulcan volcano"", the cone consists mostly of scoria and ash, but  has a carapice of spatter and lava coating the exterior. Gradual weathering of the loose cinders in these places has created cavernous holes. These look like lava tubes but actually were formed by a different process. Then there are other places on the larger cones where lava flowed in small gutters perfectly preserved with the last flows on the gutter floors.  Two humps on the south side of Vulcan are actually small volcanoes. You can stand on their tops and actually see the craters surrounded by outward-dipping spatter and lava flows.  The Albuquerque Volcanoes are the source of lavas that make up the escarpment of the Petroglyphs National Monument. In places the cliffs are over a hundred feet high. But the lava flows are only six to ten feet thick in most places and occur as a cap rock resting on softer underlying rift basin fill consisting of sands and gravels. The rest of the cliff or petroglyph slope is just armored with blocks of basalt that have tumbled from the relatively thin lava flow cap rock. Judging from these high cliffs at the edge of the lava field, one might also suppose that the volcanoes are old. But the Volcano Cliffs, as they are known locally, formed only because the Rio Grande flow gradually cut down its channel and the lateral erosion of the landscape has encroached on the lava flows from the volcanoes under cutting them and leaving them perched on escarpments.  Here is the important thing about the Albuquerque Volcanoes: Few large cities in the United States have young volcanoes near them. The Albuquerque Volcanoes are geologically young (dates range between about 190,000 and 220,000 years old) so many details of small eruptions are well preserved. What is ironic is the fact that most residents see them as such small hills on the western horizon that they could not possibly be of any interest. But it turns out that they preserve some really unusual characteristics not seen in other more spectacular volcanic settings.  They are also an excellent example of the results of a fissure eruption in which a curtain of fire erupts from a long, linear crack. Fissure eruptions like the Albuquerque Volcanoes are common in many parts of the world, particularly oceanic island volcanoes, but are not as well-expressed throughout much of the Southwest.  The Albuquerque Volcanoes we see today are the result of a fissure eruption associated with the Rio Grand rift. Fissure eruptions form because molten rock, or magma, tends to rise along vertical cracks. When the cracks reach the surface, they cause long surface fissures.  Lava and ash then erupt from the fissure. As magma quickly cools and solidifies along most of the crack, only a few points continue to erupt. Small cones of ash, spatter, and lava are built as these points of eruption continue.

Crumpler  Trail Guide to the Black Volcano, Albuquerque Volcanoes (Guide is referenced to numbers on the overhead air photo and map of trail below)  1. Trail head area. From here one may see three of the main cones that make up the north-south line of cones that are known as the Albuquerque Volcanoes; to the north is Vulcan volcano, then Black volcano, and closest to us is JA volcano. To understand what you are looking at, imagine JA Volcxano to out immediate east with a fire fountain spraying several hundred feet into the air, collapsing into pools on the slopes, and running away in re-hot streams of molten rock. This is what it looked like just before the eruption came to an end and there has been very little erosion since.  Other features to note here:  -The mass of the Sandia Mountains, literally the oldest rock in the Albuquerque area (1.4 billion years old), is visible to the east and juxtaposed behind the volcanoes to the east in stark contrast to the 220,000-year age of the volcanoes. The Manzano Mountains are to the southeast.  -Mount Taylor composite volcano, 2.5 million years old, is visible due west on the horizon. The Mount Taylor summit amphitheater, much like the one that we will walk through on this trail, opens towards us.  The two sides and back of the amphitheater crater give the appearance from Albuquerque of a three-summit mountain.  Begin walking up the trail from the parking area toward JA volcano. Notice that each of the volcanoes clearly has a ramp or apron of lavas around their bases  2. Just where the trail approaches near the lower slopes of JA Volcano  there are many white-coated rocks exposed in the trail. This is common in the Southwest. It is called caliche, and is formed by calcium carbonate, similar to the deposits left by hard water around your faucet. There are several hypotheses concerning caliche; it may be formed from ground water, deposited by surface rainfall, or may even be associated with the increased carbon dioxide associated with volcanism.  Note that the basalt has many gas bubbles or “vesicles”. The vesicles are remnants of the gas (primarily carbon dioxide gas and water vapor) that is inherent in the magma and helps to drive the eruption. Throughout the traverse, note how the vesicle size and number change depending on the type of outcrop features. As you continue on the trail, look for the beginning of a lava flow associated with JA volcano.  Lava flows are mostly to the east because the gradient at the time of eruption was toward the Rio Grande, but the build-up of the fissure line and the main volcanoes created a slope that sent many flows to the west.  As you continue to walk, you will climb up on the apron around JA Volcano that was formed from small digitate (finger-like), radiating lava flows. These form a platform around the base of the volcano. These are clearly visible in the air photo (see title page).  The lava flows around Black Volcano and somewhat larger and tended to pond forming a series of steps in the cone slopes. You may be able to see these benches or steps from here.  3. This is the second rest stop along the trail. At this point you are standing on the fissure line between JA volcano and Black volcano to the north. A little-known detail about fissure eruptions and particularly noticeable here in the Albuquerque Volcanoes fissure line is that volcanoes are not exactly aligned along the 10 km fissure trend. Each of the major volcanoes is actually on a separate shorter fissure that trends at a small angle to the northeast from the main trend line. This is because fissures in the deep crust tend to splay into shorter fissures in the upper crust due to peculiarities of the strength of rocks. Think “cracks in sidewalks” or “cracks on a wall.” They tend to be en echelon rather than one big, long crack.  Notice that Black volcano looks flat-topped from here. That is actually the rim of the summit crater that we will be climbing into. JA Volcano on the south side of the trail is a perfect example of a cinder/spatter cone with associated lava flows. As you walk past JA cone you will see evidence for red-colored scoria and cinder on the lower slopes. Unlike Black Volcano, JA Volcano has more exposures of cinder. Both volcanoes have later flows covering their slopes to the east and west and the cinders tend to be exposed on the north and south flanks.  4. The trail turns north at another rest stop where you have an excellent view of the Rio Grande valley making up the eastern half of the Rio Grande rift. Here on the fissure line of the Albuquerque volcanoes you are standing very near the center of the Rio Grande rift. The rift at the latitude of Albuquerque encompasses the area between the Rio Puerco over the western horizon and the Sandia Mountains on the east side.  From here one has an excellent view of the inner valley of the Rio Grande that includes most of the modern flood plain and is bound on the east and west by the “sandhills.” The river is the “gift of the rift” and has taken advantage of the low area produced by the rift to flow down the center of the state. This is a good place to consider the diversity of rock ages and landscapes in the Albuquerque area, and evidence for past and present geologic forces, all of which are uniquely visible from this single site.  Continue on the trail toward Black Volcano. Notice that very little lava is exposed in the saddle between JA Volcano and Black Volcano. The lava is there, but in this case it has been buried under thousands of years of dust from the west. As you walk up the trail, keep in mind that the lava flows and cinders and spatter erupted here are among the last volcanic material to be erupted from the fissure. Keep an eye open for how the last erupted material may differ from early lavas that make up much of the landscape to our east.  5. First outcrop up on the southeast margin of Black Volcano. The outcrops here are very vesicular, so we are seeing close to the top of uneroded lava flows making up the lower slopes of Black Volcano at this location. But the “outcrops” are all bulbous and irregular. This is because these are lava flows that have cascaded down the slopes and experience many local breakouts as they cooled and crusted over. As you climb up onto this black basaltic surface notice that the trail is suddenly populated with black vesicular white caliche-covered rocks. See if you can spot any digitate or finger-like flows in the shape of the miscellaneous outcrops on either side of the trail. In air photos you can make out flows radiating from the volcano. Can you spot them on the ground?  6. The trail passes into the earlier of two overlapping summit craters. Along with general dust and alluvium filling the crater, there are some reddish areas of scoria and ash making up the rim and floor of the cone. It is also a flattish area, with ramparts or margins of the dark basalt that makes up the outside of the volcano. If you look closely as we circle around the craters, you may get a sense of foliations or layers in the basalt that tell us which way the lava was flowing: In? Out? Flat-lying lava pond?  While we are up here on this prominent topographic peak, look for fulgarites on some of the boulders surrounding the summit craters. Fulgarites in this area are dark green to black glassy mark around a centimeter in diameter made by lightning strikes. Over 200, 000 years there have been many lightning strikes on these peaks since they are the highest features on the west mesa.  7. The trail enters a slightly higher elevation and the floor of the second crater. . Instead of just general soils and alluvium filling the crater here, the floor of the crater consists of scoria and cinder. The craters have not been eroded and filled all that much with later non-volcanic material. The presence of scoria and cinder here tells us that while the outside of the volcano makes it appear that the whole volcano is just dark basaltic lava, actually the basalt on the slopes is just a coating on a scoria cone much like JA Volcano to the south.  This is an original geologic surface; so all the scattered rocks and disturbed features up here are the result of later activity, mostly human.  8. The west rim of the second crater is the highest point on Black Volcano. This is a perfect place to view most of the rift valley. The Sangre de Cristo Mountains may be seen on a clear day to the northeast and just east of Santa Fe. To the east you have an excellent view of the Rio Grande valley and the eastern margin of the Rio Grande rift (formed by the fault block Sandia, Manzanita, and Manzano Mountains). In the distance to the northeast is the San Felipe shield volcano on the mesa top above San Felipe Pueblo. To the left of that is the rim of the Valles Caldera. To the south, Isleta and Los Lunas volcanoes are visible in the near distance, and beyond them to the southwest, is Sierra Ladron, which is an uplifted block of the old crystalline  “basement rock” similar to the Sandia Mountains.  Here the basalt appears mostly flat-lying but tips over onto the west slope of the volcano. If you walk 10 feet or so to the west-northwest from the summit you will see a “lava gutter”. Lava gutters are small lava channels. While they are relatively rare, lava gutters appear to be a specialty of the Albuquerque Volcanoes. If you look carefully enough, each of the volcanoes has several good examples of lava gutters. This particular example emerges from a small lava tunnel that probably drained a summit lava pond.  9. The north rim of the second crater is a well-preserved lava channel complete with levees (Figure 3). Like the lava gutters, but bigger and flat-floored, a leveed lava channel in this location must represent one of the last events in the eruption of Black Volcano. If you look carefully, you can make out the rubbly basalt stuck to the floor of the channel in its last position before everything shut down. In a sense you are looking at a lava stream that was frozen in the channel 200, 000 years ago and has remained that way since. That is an old landscape and a far cry from the mostly recent vegetated and eroded landscape of wetter parts of the continent. (Think “old-growth forest” on steroids.)  One final feature located on the east margin of this channel is something of a mystery (Figure 4). It is a vertical cylindrical hole in the lava about 10 cm in diameter. Although it could easily be a later flagpole hole, it is not. If you look closely you can see that the original lava itself has faint foliations or bands that wrap around the hole. So it appears to have been an obstacle in the original lava. Anywhere else this would be an excellent candidate for a tree mold. But on the summit of an erupting volcano? We are missing something in our understanding here.   Figure 3. Lava channel on north margin of summit crater, Black Volcano.    Figure 4. Cylindrical, vertical mystery hole in lavas forming part of the marginal levee of the lava channel shown in Figure 3.  End of Field Trip  The Park Service Says that we must Return to Trail Head Same Route! Argh!!  Trail Guide to the JA Volcano, Albuquerque Volcanoes [Currently, the National Park Service has closed access to JA Volcano. In order to follow the guide below, you must obtain permission to access the JA volcano trail from the Petroglyph National Monument vistor''s center.]  (Guide is referenced to numbers on overhead air photo and map of trail)    Points of interest along the JA volcano trail.  1. Trail head area: From here one may see three of the main cones that make up the north-south line of cones known as the Albuquerque Volcanoes; to the north is Vulcan volcano, then Black volcano, and closest to us is JA volcano.  -The mass of the Sandia Mountains, literally the oldest rock in the Albuquerque area (1.4 billion years old), is visible to the east and juxtaposed behind the volcanoes to the east in stark contrast to the 220,000-year age of the volcanoes. The Manzano Mountains are to the southeast.  -Mount Taylor composite volcano, 2.5 million years old, is visible due west on the horizon. The Mount Taylor summit amphitheater, much like the one that we will walk through on this trail, opens towards us.  The two sides and back of the amphitheater crater give the appearance from Albuquerque of a three-summit mountain.  Begin walking up the trail from the parking area toward JA volcano. Notice that each of the volcanoes clearly has a ramp or apron of lavas around their bases.   2. Just to the east of the white arrow at the trail side there are many white-coated rocks  exposed in the trail. This is common in the Southwest. It is called caliche, and is formed by  calcium carbonate, similar to the deposits left by hard water around your faucet. There are  several hypotheses concerning caliche; it may be formed from ground water, deposited by  surface rainfall, or may even be associated with the increased carbon dioxide associated with  volcanism. Note that the basalt has many gas bubbles or “vesicles”. The vesicles are remnants  of the gas (primarily carbon dioxide gas and water vapor) that is inherent in the magma and  helps to drive the eruption. Throughout the traverse, note how the vesicle size and number  change depending on the type of outcrop features. As you continue on the trail, look for the  beginning of a lava flow associated with JA volcano.  Lava flows are mostly to the east-west  because the gradient at the time of eruption was toward the Rio Grande.  As you continue to  walk, you will climb up on the apron of small digitate (finger-like), radiating lava flows  that form a platform around the base of the volcano. These are clearly visible in the air  photo and were erupted on top of the first lava flow you saw on the trail.   3. This is the second rest stop along the trail. At this point you are standing on the fissure  line between JA volcano and Black volcano to the north. Notice that Black volcano looks  flat-topped from here. That is actually the rim of the summit crater.  To the east you have an excellent view of the Rio Grande valley. Here on the fissure line of the Albuquerque Volcanoes you are standing very near the center of the Rio Grande rift. The rift starts in the area of the Rio Puerco over the western horizon and goes all the way over to the base of the Sandia Mountains.  JA volcano is a perfect example of a cinder/spatter cone with associated lava flows. As you walk up JA cone you will see excellent examples of many of the physical and textural features of a cinder cone-style volcano.  Start the ascent up the trail toward the summit of JA cone. As you walk up the trail, keep in mind that the lava flows, cinders and spatter erupted here are among the last volcanic material to be erupted from the fissure. Keep an eye open for how the last erupted material may differ from early lavas.   4. First outcrop up on the north flank of JA volcano.  -small opening surrounded by moss near the edge to west of the trail = moist ambient subsurface air.  Hold your hand in front of this opening (do not reach inside) and you will feel warm air in winter and cool air in summer. The warm air has made many people believe that the volcano is still active; however, you are simply feeling the ambient air temperature protected by the insulation properties of the basalt.  -large spatter lumps and agglomerated fluid clasts may be seen in some of the outcrops.   5. Farther up the slope you arrive at a large cave. This may be part of a small lava tube that  formed in the lavas that were draining away from the summit of the volcano. Note the odd lumpy  shapes of the lava – formed by welded spatter. Notice that above the opening there is a  fragment of pre-existing rock (sandstone) that has been caught up in the eruption. Do not go  inside. As you continue up and around the “cave” and follow the trail you will see a classic  lava gutter to your left just above the “cave.” The layers in the upper walls of the gutter  illustrate one way that an open channel or gutter may evolve into a closed tube as an eruption  progresses and walls build up and solidify into a roof.   6. The trail passes through a reddish area that is scoria and ash making up the rim of the  main crater. It is also a flattish area, with outward dipping margins, that appears to have  provided a source for the lava tube and gutter we just walked past, so this is probably a  small vent area or short-lived lava pond. The question here is why is some scoria black and  some red? The answer is probably small changes in oxygen gas content causing oxidation in some  areas and not in others – but this is a question that is still not totally solved by  volcanologists. The basalt lava around the margins and just west along the rim here is very  dark, but banded as though made up of many pulses. Look for fulgarites (glassy marks of  lightning strikes) on some of the boulders surrounding the lava pond.   7. The outcrops here are bedded or banded, and the plane of the bands slope or dip towards the  center of the main crater. Locally the surface of the lava and spatter is grooved; these are  stretch marks as the hot and plastic spatter slid down the rim toward the crater.   8. The multiple bands of light and dark lava here shows how the eruption changes back and  forth from more solidified pyroclastic clots to fluid clots that are hot enough to weld  together.   9. Here on the south rim one may see many separate layers of spatter that built up as the  volcano erupted. Walk up the trail to the inward dipping layers of spatter on the west rim of  the crater or walk on the trail across the crater to the south rim.   Both sites will give you  a close-up view of the welded layers of spatter. Notice the layers of fluid-looking spatter  that have welded together to form solid rock.  They were erupted as part of the  fire-fountaining of the crater and then fell back into the crater welding into solid rock and  forming inward-dipping coating.  This is a perfect place to view most of the rift valley. The Sangre de Cristo Mountains may be seen on a clear day to the northeast and just east of Santa Fe. To the east you have an excellent view of the Rio Grande valley and the eastern margin of the Rio Grande rift (formed by the fault block Sandia, Manzanita, and Manzano Mountains). In the near distance to the northeast is the San Felipe shield volcano on the mesa top above San Felipe Pueblo. To the south, Isleta and Los Lunas volcanoes are visible in the near distance, and beyond them to the southwest, is Sierra Ladron, which is an uplift similar to the Sandias that marks the western margin of the rift.   10. The low notch on the east side of the crater here is not just the result of water erosion.  If you look carefully, you will see evidence that lava actually poured out the crater here and  left behind fins and grooves. As you walk down this notch, you will walk along the geologic  contact between the scoria/spatter forming the volcano and the youngest lava flow erupted from  the crater late in the history of the cinder cone. The lava that flowed out from this volcano  probably supplied the lava flows that make up the escarpment lavas visible way off to the east  near Unser Boulevard and Rinconada Canyon. Many of the same features that we have seen in the  lava flows here may also be found at the head of Rinconada Canyon.   11. Down here we are off the main cone and on the apron of lava flows. At this point someone  has penetrated the lava flows and exposed clinkery cinder that was erupted just before these  very last lava flows. The opening has also exposed what may be one of many small discontinuous  lava tubes within the lava flows of the Albuquerque volcanic field.   12. The third rest area. From here you have an excellent view of the inner valley of the Rio  Grande from the center of the Rio Grande rift. The river is the “gift of the rift” and has  taken advantage of the low area produced by the rift to flow down the center of the state.  This is a good place to consider the diversity of rock ages and landscapes in the Albuquerque  area, and evidence for past and present geologic forces, all of which are uniquely visible  from this single site. And JA volcano is a remarkable example of fissure-style cinder/spatter  cone.    Winter scene of the southern three vents of the Albuquerque Volcanoes.

JA volcano is the closest volcano. Note the small digitate lava flows radiating from the volcano. Photo L. Crumpler 1. How old are they?  The Albuquerque Volcanoes are as young as 140,000 years. There are several methods of determining ages of basaltic volcanic rocks and each can yield a slightly different result. Some methods yield an age closer to 200,000 years. Ages between 160,000 to 200,000 years old are currently the dates that appear most reasonable based on comparison with geomorphic surfaces around the volcanoes and other factors. Any of these dates are young by the standards of geologic time. Volcanoes younger than 200,000 years in the Southwest are generally well preserved and with the exception of some erosion of their slopes, look close to the morphology they had immediately after eruptions ceased.  Rather than erupting individually like many small fields of volcanoes in the Southwest, the Albuquerque volcanoes all formed simultaneously. This is because they all erupted from the same fissure eruption. The actual eruption probably took place over a period of months to years. To the south and west of Belen and Los Lunas there is another series of cinder cones called the Cat Hills volcanoes. These are slightly younger and consist of more typical cinders and agglomerate.  2. Will they erupt again?  Small volcanoes do not reactivate like big volcanoes, but the area around Albuquerque remains potentially active, mainly because of its location in the Rio Grande rift. A new volcano could erupt, if not along the Albuquerque Volcanoes, at least somewhere within the rift.  One of the larger earthquake swarms in New Mexico occurred in 1972 beneath the volcanoes. There is no particular evidence that this was new magma moving up a crack. Instead, the earthquake swarm may have been re-adjustments of dikes and faults at great depth as the deeper portions of the dike continue to cool and contract.  Many people visiting the volcanoes in the winter months have noticed ""warm"" air in the caves. This is probably not ""volcanic heat"", but instead is ambient air trapped in the subsurface that feels warm compared with the cold outside air. If one were to visit the same caves during the summer, one would find them cool compared with the outside air. The caves simply record the temperature of Albuquerque ""averaged"" over a year, which is around 55 degrees F, a temperature that feels warm in the winter and cool in the summer.  3. How did they form?  If you were to look down on the Albuquerque Volcanoes you would see that they are arranged in a nearly straight line. This also is apparent if you stand on top of one volcano and look across to the next one. This is simply because they erupted along a fracture in the crust. Fractures of this type along which eruptions take place are referred to as ""fissure eruptions"". Many of the eruptions in Hawaii are fissure eruptions in which the fissures frequently extend outward from summit craters or calderas. The fractures in Hawaii are thought to result from the gradual sliding of parts of the sides of the large volcanoes that make up the Hawaiian islands.  Fissures also occur in Iceland where the crust is being pulled apart along the Mid Atlantic ridge. In New Mexico the fractures have an origin similar to those in Iceland. Here the fractures are part of the faults that formed where the crust has been pulled apart by forces similar to those in Iceland. The eruption that resulted in the Albuquerque Volcanoes probably looked similar to eruptions in Iceland. Although the Albuquerque Volcanoes appear to occur in a straight line, they are actually arranged in slightly offset segments like the fissure in this example from Iceland. This is probably a good analogy of what they looked like when they started erupting and before the eruptions centralized on several spots. Once the eruptions centralized on these spots, the cones that we see today began to build up.  The stretching that helped create the Albuquerque Volcanoes has resulted in the development of the Rio Grande rift. The rift valleys of eastern Africa are another example of similar stretching and pulling apart of Earth''s crust. The East African rift and the Rio Grande rift are two of the youngest and largest continental rifts currently active on Earth. (This is probably one reason why East African and New Mexico are among the most geologically, and ecologically, interesting and exotic places on Earth.)  Fissure eruptions occur when conditions are right in the mantle for the existence of partially melted rock (magma) and faults act as conduits for the rise of magma to the surface. When a vertical crack filled with molten magma (known as a ""dike"") intersects the surface, a line of eruption takes place. If the dike is particularly large and deep, the line of eruption or fissure is long, like the Albuquerque Volcanoes. Other dikes are smaller and the associated fissure eruptions at the surface are relatively short.  4. Why are the Albuquerque Volcanoes important and unusual?  Most of the scoria cones and volcanoes in New Mexico and throughout the Southwestern U.S. are the result of smaller fissure eruptions. This is one reason why the Albuquerque Volcanoes are so unusual and geologically interesting. They are an excellent example of fissure eruption. In addition, few large cities in the United States have such young basaltic volcanoes nearby (within a few minutes drive of downtown) that are also an important part of the metropolitan landscape.  The Albuquerque Volcanoes are also an unusual type of scoria cone. Many scoria cones in the Southwest are piles of cinder. Examples are Capulin volcano, Bandera Crater, and Sunset Crater. Some of the Albuquerque Volcanoes like Vulcan, the largest cone, are cones formed from spatter and thin lava flows coating an interior of cinder.  5. What are they made of?  The Volcanoes are basalt, a type of lava that consists largely of the minerals plagioclase, olivine, pyroxene, and magnetite. There are two principal types of basaltic lava in the Southwest: alkali basalt and tholeiite, defined on the basis of the relative abundances of sodium and potassium. The Albuquerque Volcanoes are made of tholeiite that is low in sodium and especially potassium. These different types of lava reflect the differences in the depth and composition of the mantle rocks that were melted and erupted. By comparison, the youngest lava of El Malpais (McCartys lava flow) is tholeiite. Many of the volcanic fields, like Mount Taylor''s collection of small volcanoes, also on the western horizon of Albuquerque, are alkali basalt.

The oddly circular lavas on the left are part of the more andesitic eruptions that took place from the center of the composite of three eruption sites. While it is possible that the circularity is a result of symmetrical ""puddling"" of the lavas at the base of the central cone, it is also likely that the lavas encountered and filled  pre-existing maar type craters.

This area also roughly outlines the extent of most of the shallow earthquake activity within New Mexico. In the lower right is a depiction oif one possible arrangment of the magam body. Conceptually, dikes periodically ascending from the mantle source stall at the mid-crustal boundary. Flexure of the overlying brittle crust gives rise to the abundant seismicity. .  The SMB lies at the southern end of the Albu­querque basin part of the Rio Grande rift (see image above). It is strictly defined as a mid-crustal anomaly identi­fied by geophysical observations. These include the presence of unusual crustal properties, defined by analysis of the way seismic energy is reflected from the surface of the proposed magma body and transmitted through the crust from distant (teleseis­mic) earthquakes, and by the concentrated distribu­tion of earthquakes. These observations define the presence of a crustal anomaly, but it is the close spatial correlation with the Socorro seismic anom­aly (SSA) (Sanford et al., 1977), one of the most seismically active parts of the rift, that implies volume moments associated with active magma movement.  The SSA is a roughly 5000 km2 area of intense micoearthquake activity that coincides with the greater than 3400 km2 area (Balch, 1992; Balch et al., 1997) of the SMB defined from reflection data. Most of the microearth­quakes in the SSA are located between a depth of 4 to 14 km (Jiracek et al., 1987). This is within the brittle zone lying above the approximate 20 km depth of the SMB mid-crustal anomaly. That the seismicity is anomalous is apparent when one considers that 45 percent of the total seismicity above magnitude 2.5 in New Mexico occurs within this area, yet it occupies only 2 percent of the area of the state (Balch, 1992). Hypotheses for the origin of the microearthquake activity include fractures caused by bending stresses in the brittle upper crust as the magma body inflates and frac­tures are induced during small vertical diking events. The inset in the lower right corner of the state map above and the drawing below is a simplified depiction of a possible configuration of the SMB and its feeder dikes. The salient characteristic is the great width relative to the thickness. Geophysical work to date suggests that the SMB is on the order of 0.1 to 0.5 km thick and contains a volume of 102 to 103 km3 (Ake and Sanford, 1987).    Drawing depicting the geometry of the proposed Socorro magma body. The main body occurs as a sheet roughly 100 m thick spread out at the interface between the upper and lower crust.  The volume of actual melt is not well con­strained. Current methods do not resolve whether the region is comprised of a series of sheets sepa­rated by layers of solid or whether the entire layer consists of some large fraction of melt. It is likely that the layer is supplied by frequent arrivals of melt via dikes from the mantle source region. Occasion­ally, some dikes may move upward above the magma body to shallower (a few km) depths, based on the apparent presence of shallow bodies in the vi­cinity of Socorro (Sanford, 1979; Roach, 1982).

For other uses, see Volcano (disambiguation) and Volcanic (disambiguation). For broader coverage of this topic, see Volcanism. A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface.  On Earth, volcanoes are most often found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater. For example, a mid-oceanic ridge, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates whereas the Pacific Ring of Fire has volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the crust''s plates, such as in the East African Rift and the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and Rio Grande Rift in North America. Volcanism away from plate boundaries has been postulated to arise from upwelling diapirs from the core–mantle boundary, 3,000 kilometers (1,900 mi) deep in the Earth. This results in hotspot volcanism, of which the Hawaiian hotspot is an example. Volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another.

These are in slow motion, due to convection in the underlying ductile mantle, and most volcanic activity on Earth takes place along plate boundaries, where plates are converging (and lithosphere is being destroyed) or are diverging (and new lithosphere is being created.)[3]  Divergent plate boundaries Main article: Divergent boundary At the mid-oceanic ridges, two tectonic plates diverge from one another as hot mantle rock creeps upwards beneath the thinned oceanic crust. The decrease of pressure in the rising mantle rock leads to adiabatic expansion and the partial melting of the rock, causing volcanism and creating new oceanic crust. Most divergent plate boundaries are at the bottom of the oceans, and so most volcanic activity on the Earth is submarine, forming new seafloor. Black smokers (also known as deep sea vents) are evidence of this kind of volcanic activity. Where the mid-oceanic ridge is above sea level, volcanic islands are formed, such as Iceland.[4]  Convergent plate boundaries Main article: Convergent boundary Subduction zones are places where two plates, usually an oceanic plate and a continental plate, collide. The oceanic plate subducts (dives beneath the continental plate), forming a deep ocean trench just offshore. In a process called flux melting, water released from the subducting plate lowers the melting temperature of the overlying mantle wedge, thus creating magma. This magma tends to be extremely viscous because of its high silica content, so it often does not reach the surface but cools and solidifies at depth. When it does reach the surface, however, a volcano is formed. Thus subduction zones are bordered by chains of volcanoes called volcanic arcs. Typical examples are the volcanoes in the Pacific Ring of Fire, such as the Cascade Volcanoes or the Japanese Archipelago, or the Sunda Arc of Indonesia.[5]  Hotspots Main article: Hotspot (geology) Hotspots are volcanic areas thought to be formed by mantle plumes, which are hypothesized to be columns of hot material rising from the core-mantle boundary. As with mid-ocean ridges, the rising mantle rock experiences decompression melting which generates large volumes of magma. Because tectonic plates move across mantle plumes, each volcano becomes inactive as it drifts off the plume, and new volcanoes are created where the plate advances over the plume. The Hawaiian Islands are thought to have been formed in such a manner, as has the Snake River Plain, with the Yellowstone Caldera being the part of the North American plate currently above the Yellowstone hotspot.[6] However, the mantle plume hypothesis has been questioned.[7]  Continental rifting Main article: Rift Sustained upwelling of hot mantle rock can develop under the interior of a continent and lead to rifting. Early stages of rifting are characterized by flood basalts and may progress to the point where a tectonic plate is completely split.[8][9] A divergent plate boundary then develops between the two halves of the split plate. However, rifting often fails to completely split the continental lithosphere (such as in an aulacogen), and failed rifts are characterized by volcanoes that erupt unusual alkali lava or carbonatites. Examples include the volcanoes of the East African Rift.[10]  Volcanic features Further information: Types of volcanoes  Lakagigar fissure vent in Iceland, the source of the major world climate alteration of 1783–84, has a chain of volcanic cones along its length.  Skjaldbreiður, a shield volcano whose name means ""broad shield"" The most common perception of a volcano is of a conical mountain, spewing lava and poisonous gases from a crater at its summit; however, this describes just one of the many types of volcano. The features of volcanoes are much more complicated and their structure and behavior depends on a number of factors. Some volcanoes have rugged peaks formed by lava domes rather than a summit crater while others have landscape features such as massive plateaus. Vents that issue volcanic material (including lava and ash) and gases (mainly steam and magmatic gases) can develop anywhere on the landform and may give rise to smaller cones such as Puʻu ʻŌʻō on a flank of Hawaii''s Kīlauea. Other types of volcano include cryovolcanoes (or ice volcanoes), particularly on some moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune; and mud volcanoes, which are formations often not associated with known magmatic activity. Active mud volcanoes tend to involve temperatures much lower than those of igneous volcanoes except when the mud volcano is actually a vent of an igneous volcano.  Fissure vents Main article: Fissure vent Volcanic fissure vents are flat, linear fractures through which lava emerges.  Shield volcanoes Main article: Shield volcano Shield volcanoes, so named for their broad, shield-like profiles, are formed by the eruption of low-viscosity lava that can flow a great distance from a vent. They generally do not explode catastrophically, but are characterized by relatively gentle effusive eruptions. Since low-viscosity magma is typically low in silica, shield volcanoes are more common in oceanic than continental settings. The Hawaiian volcanic chain is a series of shield cones, and they are common in Iceland, as well.  Lava domes Main article: Lava dome Lava domes are built by slow eruptions of highly viscous lava. They are sometimes formed within the crater of a previous volcanic eruption, as in the case of Mount St. Helens, but can also form independently, as in the case of Lassen Peak. Like stratovolcanoes, they can produce violent, explosive eruptions, but the lava generally does not flow far from the originating vent.  Cryptodomes Cryptodomes are formed when viscous lava is forced upward causing the surface to bulge. The 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was an example; lava beneath the surface of the mountain created an upward bulge, which later collapsed down the north side of the mountain.  Cinder cones Main articles: volcanic cone and Cinder cone  Izalco volcano, the youngest volcano in El Salvador. Izalco erupted almost continuously from 1770 (when it formed) to 1958, earning it the nickname of ""Lighthouse of the Pacific"". Cinder cones result from eruptions of mostly small pieces of scoria and pyroclastics (both resemble cinders, hence the name of this volcano type) that build up around the vent. These can be relatively short-lived eruptions that produce a cone-shaped hill perhaps 30 to 400 meters (98 to 1,312 ft) meters high. Most cinder cones erupt only once. Cinder cones may form as flank vents on larger volcanoes, or occur on their own. Parícutin in Mexico and Sunset Crater in Arizona are examples of cinder cones. In New Mexico, Caja del Rio is a volcanic field of over 60 cinder cones.  Based on satellite images, it was suggested that cinder cones might occur on other terrestrial bodies in the Solar system too; on the surface of Mars and the Moon.[11][12][13][14]  Stratovolcanoes (composite volcanoes)  Cross-section through a stratovolcano (vertical scale is exaggerated): Large magma chamber Bedrock Conduit (pipe) Base Sill Dike Layers of ash emitted by the volcano Flank Layers of lava emitted by the volcano Throat Parasitic cone Lava flow Vent Crater Ash cloud Main article: Stratovolcano Stratovolcanoes (composite volcanoes) are tall conical mountains composed of lava flows and tephra in alternate layers, the strata that gives rise to the name. Stratovolcanoes are also known as composite volcanoes because they are created from multiple structures during different kinds of eruptions. Classic examples include Mount Fuji in Japan, Mayon Volcano in the Philippines, and Mount Vesuvius and Stromboli in Italy.  Ash produced by the explosive eruption of stratovolcanoes has historically posed the greatest volcanic hazard to civilizations. The lavas of stratovolcanoes are higher in silica, and therefore much more viscous, than lavas from shield volcanoes. High-silica lavas also tend to contain more dissolved gas. The combination is deadly, promoting explosive eruptions that produce great quantities of ash, as well as pyroclastic surges like the one that destroyed the city of Saint-Pierre in Martinique in 1902. Stratovolcanoes are also steeper than shield volcanoes, with slopes of 30–35° compared to slopes of generally 5–10°, and their loose tephra are material for dangerous lahars.[15] Large pieces of tephra are called volcanic bombs. Big bombs can measure more than 4 feet(1.2 meters) across and weigh several tons.[16]  Supervolcanoes Main article: Supervolcano See also: List of largest volcanic eruptions A supervolcano is a volcano that has experienced one or more eruptions that produced over 1,000 cubic kilometers (240 cu mi) of volcanic deposits in a single explosive event.[17] Such eruptions occur when a very large magma chamber full of gas-rich, silicic magma is emptied in a catastrophic caldera-forming eruption. Ash flow tuffs emplaced by such eruptions are the only volcanic product with volumes rivaling those of flood basalts.[18]  A supervolcano can produce devastation on a continental scale. Such volcanoes are able to severely cool global temperatures for many years after the eruption due to the huge volumes of sulfur and ash released into the atmosphere. They are the most dangerous type of volcano. Examples include Yellowstone Caldera in Yellowstone National Park and Valles Caldera in New Mexico (both western United States); Lake Taupo in New Zealand; Lake Toba in Sumatra, Indonesia; and Ngorongoro Crater in Tanzania. Fortunately, supervolcano eruptions are very rare events, though because of the enormous area they cover, and subsequent concealment under vegetation and glacial deposits, supervolcanoes can be difficult to identify in the geologic record without careful geologic mapping.[19]  Submarine volcanoes Main article: Submarine volcano See also: Subaqueous volcano Submarine volcanoes are common features of the ocean floor. Volcanic activity during the Holocene Epoch has been documented at only 119 submarine volcanoes. but there may be more than one million geologically young submarine volcanoes on the ocean floor.[20][21] In shallow water, active volcanoes disclose their presence by blasting steam and rocky debris high above the ocean''s surface. In the deep ocean basins, the tremendous weight of the water prevents the explosive release of steam and gases; however, submarine eruptions can be detected by hydrophones and by the discoloration of water because of volcanic gases. Pillow lava is a common eruptive product of submarine volcanoes and is characterized by thick sequences of discontinuous pillow-shaped masses which form under water. Even large submarine eruptions may not disturb the ocean surface, due to the rapid cooling effect and increased buoyancy in water (as compared to air), which often causes volcanic vents to form steep pillars on the ocean floor. Hydrothermal vents are common near these volcanoes, and some support peculiar ecosystems based on chemotrophs feeding on dissolved minerals. Over time, the formations created by submarine volcanoes may become so large that they break the ocean surface as new islands or floating pumice rafts.  In May and June 2018, a multitude of seismic signals were detected by earthquake monitoring agencies all over the world. They took the form of unusual humming sounds, and some of the signals detected in November of that year had a duration of up to 20 minutes. An oceanographic research campaign in May 2019 showed that the previously mysterious humming noises were caused by the formation of a submarine volcano off the coast of Mayotte.[22]  Subglacial volcanoes Main article: Subglacial volcano Subglacial volcanoes develop underneath icecaps. They are made up of lava plateaus capping extensive pillow lavas and palagonite. These volcanoes are also called table mountains, tuyas,[23] or (in Iceland) mobergs.[24] Very good examples of this type of volcano can be seen in Iceland and in British Columbia. The origin of the term comes from Tuya Butte, which is one of the several tuyas in the area of the Tuya River and Tuya Range in northern British Columbia. Tuya Butte was the first such landform analyzed and so its name has entered the geological literature for this kind of volcanic formation.[25] The Tuya Mountains Provincial Park was recently established to protect this unusual landscape, which lies north of Tuya Lake and south of the Jennings River near the boundary with the Yukon Territory.  Mud volcanoes Main article: Mud volcano Mud volcanoes (mud domes) are formations created by geo-excreted liquids and gases, although there are several processes which may cause such activity.[26] The largest structures are 10 kilometers in diameter and reach 700 meters high.[27]  Erupted material  Pāhoehoe lava flow on Hawaii. The picture shows overflows of a main lava channel.  The Stromboli stratovolcano off the coast of Sicily has erupted continuously for thousands of years, giving rise to its nickname ""Lighthouse of the Mediterranean"" The material that is expelled in a volcanic eruption can be classified into three types:  Volcanic gases, a mixture made mostly of steam, carbon dioxide, and a sulfur compound (either sulfur dioxide, SO2, or hydrogen sulfide, H2S, depending on the temperature) Lava, the name of magma when it emerges and flows over the surface Tephra, particles of solid material of all shapes and sizes ejected and thrown through the air[28][29] Volcanic gases Main article: Volcanic gas The concentrations of different volcanic gases can vary considerably from one volcano to the next. Water vapor is typically the most abundant volcanic gas, followed by carbon dioxide[30] and sulfur dioxide. Other principal volcanic gases include hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fluoride. A large number of minor and trace gases are also found in volcanic emissions, for example hydrogen, carbon monoxide, halocarbons, organic compounds, and volatile metal chlorides.  Lava flows Main article: Lava flow Composition Main article: Volcanic rock File:Sarychev Peak eruption on 12 June 2009, oblique satellite view.ogv Sarychev Peak eruption, Matua Island, oblique satellite view The form and style of eruption of a volcano is largely determined by the composition of the lava it erupts. The viscosity (how fluid the lava is) and the amount of dissolved gas are the most important characteristics of magma, and both are largely determined by the amount of silica in the magma. Magma rich in silica is much more viscous than silica-poor magma, and silica-rich magma also tends to contain more dissolved gases.  Lava can be broadly classified into four different compositions:[31]  If the erupted magma contains a high percentage (>63%) of silica, the lava is described as felsic. Felsic lavas (dacites or rhyolites) are highly viscous and are erupted as domes or short, stubby flows.[32] Lassen Peak in California is an example of a volcano formed from felsic lava and is actually a large lava dome.[33] Because felsic magmas are so viscous, they tend to trap volatiles (gases) that are present, which leads to explosive volcanism. Pyroclastic flows (ignimbrites) are highly hazardous products of such volcanoes, since they hug the volcano''s slopes and travel far from their vents during large eruptions. Temperatures as high as 850 °C (1,560 °F)[34] are known to occur in pyroclastic flows, which will incinerate everything flammable in their path, and thick layers of hot pyroclastic flow deposits can be laid down, often many meters thick.[35] Alaska''s Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, formed by the eruption of Novarupta near Katmai in 1912, is an example of a thick pyroclastic flow or ignimbrite deposit.[36] Volcanic ash that is light enough to be erupted high into the Earth''s atmosphere as an eruption column may travel hundreds of kilometers before it falls back to ground as a fallout tuff. Volcanic gases may remain in the stratosphere for years.[37]  Felsic magmas are formed within the crust, usually through melting of crust rock from the heat of underlying mafic magmas. The lighter felsic magma floats on the mafic magma without significant mixing.[38] Less commonly, felsic magmas are produced by extreme fractional crystallization of more mafic magmas.[39] This is a process in which mafic minerals crystallize out of the slowly cooling magma, which enriches the remaining liquid in silica.  If the erupted magma contains 52–63% silica, the lava is of intermediate composition or andesitic. Intermediate magmas are characteristic of stratovolcanoes.[40] They are most commonly formed at convergent boundaries between tectonic plates, by several processes. One process is hydration melting of mantle peridotite followed by fractional crystallization. Water from a subducting slab rises into the overlying mantle, lowering its melting point, particularly for the more silica-rich minerals. Fractional crystallization further enriches the magma in silica. It has also been suggested that intermediate magmas are produced by melting of sediments carried downwards by the subducted slab.[41] Another process is magma mixing between felsic rhyolitic and mafic basaltic magmas in an intermediate reservoir prior to emplacement or lava flow.[42] If the erupted magma contains <52% and >45% silica, the lava is called mafic (because it contains higher percentages of magnesium (Mg) and iron (Fe)) or basaltic. These lavas are usually hotter and much less viscous than felsic lavas. Mafic magmas are formed by partial melting of dry mantle, with limited fractional crystallization and assimilation of crustal material.[43] Mafic lavas occur in a wide range of settings. These include mid-ocean ridges; Shield volcanoes (such the Hawaiian Islands, including Mauna Loa and Kilauea), on both oceanic and continental crust; and as continental flood basalts.  Some erupted magmas contain <=45% silica and produce ultramafic lava. Ultramafic flows, also known as komatiites, are very rare; indeed, very few have been erupted at the Earth''s surface since the Proterozoic, when the planet''s heat flow was higher. They are (or were) the hottest lavas, and were probably more fluid than common mafic lavas, with a viscosity less than a tenth that of hot basalt magma.[44] Lava texture Mafic lava flows show two varieties of surface texture: ʻAʻa (pronounced [ˈʔaʔa]) and pāhoehoe ([paːˈho.eˈho.e]), both Hawaiian words. ʻAʻa is characterized by a rough, clinkery surface and is the typical texture of cooler basalt lava flows. Pāhoehoe is characterized by its smooth and often ropey or wrinkly surface and is generally formed from more fluid lava flows. Pāhoehoe flows are sometimes observed to transition to ʻaʻa flows as they move away from the vent, but never the reverse.[45].  More silicic lava flows take the form of block lava, where the flow is covered with angular, vesicle-poor blocks. Rhyolitic flows typically consist largely of obsidian.[46]  Tephra Main article: Tephra  Light-microscope image of tuff as seen in thin section (long dimension is several mm): The curved shapes of altered glass shards (ash fragments) are well preserved, although the glass is partly altered. The shapes were formed about bubbles of expanding, water-rich gas. Tephra is made when magma inside the volcano is blown apart by the rapid expansion of hot volcanic gases. Magma commonly explodes as the gas dissolved in it comes out of solution as the pressure decreases when it flows to the surface. These violent explosions produce particles of material that can then fly from the volcano. Solid particles smaller than 2 mm in diameter (sand-sized or smaller) are called volcanic ash.[28][29]  Tephra and other volcaniclastics (shattered volcanic material) make up more of the volume of many volcanoes than do lava flows. Volcaniclastics may have contributed as much as a third of all sedimentation in the geologic record. The production of large volumes of tephra is characteristic of explosive volcanism.[47]  Types of volcanic eruptions Main article: Types of volcanic eruptions Eruption styles are broadly divided into magmatic, phreatomagmatic, and phreatic eruptions.[48]  Magmatic eruptions Magmatic eruptions are driven primarily by gas release due to decompression.[48] Low-viscosity magma with little dissolved gas produces relatively gentle effusive eruptions. High-viscosity magma with a high content of dissolved gas produces violent explosive eruptions. The range of observed eruption styles is expressed from historical examples.  Hawaiian eruptions are typical of volcanoes that erupt mafic lava with a relatively low gas content. These are almost entirely effusive, producing local fire fountains and highly fluid lava flows but relatively little tephra. They are named after the Hawaiian volcanoes.  Strombolian eruptions are characterized by moderate viscosities and dissolved gas levels. They are characterized by frequent but short-lived eruptions that can produce eruptive columns hundreds of meters high. Their primary product is scoria. They are named after Stromboli.  Vulcanian eruptions are characterized by yet higher viscosities and partial crystallization of magma, which is often intermediate in composition. Eruptions take the form of short-lived explosions over the course of several hours, which destroy a central dome and eject large lava blocks and bombs. This is followed by an effusive phase that rebuilds the central dome. Vulcanian eruptions are named after Vulcano.  Peléan eruptions are more violent still, being characterized by dome growth and collapse that produces various kinds of pyroclastic flows. They are named after Mount Pelée.  Plinian eruptions are the most violent of all volcanic eruptions. They are characterized by sustained huge eruption columns whose collapse produces catastrophic pyroclastic flows. They are named after Pliny the Younger, who chronicled the Plinian eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.  The intensity of explosive volcanism is expressed using the Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI), which ranges from 0 for Hawaiian-type eruptions to 8 for supervolcanic eruptions.[49]  Phreatomagmatic eruptions Main article: Phreatomagmatic eruptions Phreatomagmatic eruptions are characterized by interaction of rising magma with groundwater. They are driven by the resulting rapid buildup of pressure in the superheated groundwater.  Phreatic eruptions Main article: Phreatic eruptions Phreatic eruptions are characterized by superheating of groundwater that comes in contact with hot rock or magma. They are distinguished from phreatomagmatic eruptions because the erupted material is all country rock; no new magma is erupted.  Volcanic activity  Fresco with Mount Vesuvius behind Bacchus and Agathodaemon, as seen in Pompeii''s House of the Centenary Volcanoes vary greatly in their level of activity, with individual volcanic systems having an eruption recurrence ranging from several times a year to once in tens of thousands of years.[50] Volcanoes are informally described as active, dormant, or extinct, but these terms are poorly defined.[51]  Active See also: Category:Active volcanoes, Category:Potentially active volcanoes, and List of currently erupting volcanoes There is no consensus among volcanologists on how to define an ""active"" volcano. The lifespan of a volcano can vary from months to several million years, making such a distinction sometimes meaningless when compared to the lifespans of humans or even civilizations. For example, many of Earth''s volcanoes have erupted dozens of times in the past few thousand years but are not currently showing signs of eruption. Given the long lifespan of such volcanoes, they are very active. By human lifespans, however, they are not.  Scientists usually consider a volcano to be erupting or likely to erupt if it is currently erupting, or showing signs of unrest such as unusual earthquake activity or significant new gas emissions. Most scientists consider a volcano active if it has erupted in the last 10,000 years (Holocene times)—the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program uses this definition of active. As of September 2020, the Program recognizes 1,420 active volcanoes that have had eruptions during the Holocene Epoch.[20] Most volcanoes are situated on the Pacific Ring of Fire.[52] An estimated 500 million people live near active volcanoes.[52]  Historical time (or recorded history) is another timeframe for active.[53][54] However, the span of recorded history differs from region to region. In China and the Mediterranean, it reaches back nearly 3,000 years, but in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada, it reaches back less than 300 years, and in Hawaii and New Zealand, only around 200 years.[53] The incomplete Catalogue of the Active Volcanoes of the World, published in parts between 1951 and 1975 by the International Association of Volcanology, uses this definition, by which there are more than 500 active volcanoes.[53][55] As of September 2020, the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program recognizes 562 volcanoes with confirmed historical eruptions.[20]   Kīlauea''s lava entering the sea  Lava flows at Holuhraun, Iceland, September 2014 As of 2013, the following are considered Earth''s most active volcanoes:[56]  Kīlauea, the famous Hawaiian volcano, was in nearly continuous, effusive eruption (in which lava steadily flows onto the ground) between 1983 through 2018, and had the longest-observed lava lake. Mount Etna and nearby Stromboli, two Mediterranean volcanoes in ""almost continuous eruption""[vague] since antiquity.[clarification needed] Piton de la Fournaise, in Réunion, erupts frequently enough to be a tourist attraction. As of 2010, the longest ongoing (but not necessarily continuous) volcanic eruptive phases are:[57]  Mount Yasur, 111 years Mount Etna, 109 years Stromboli, 108 years Santa María, 101 years Sangay, 94 years Other very active volcanoes include:  Mount Nyiragongo and its neighbor, Nyamuragira, are Africa''s most active volcanoes  Nyiragongo''s lava lake . Erta Ale, in the Afar Triangle, has maintained a lava lake since at least 1906. Mount Erebus, in Antarctica, has maintained a lava lake since at least 1972. Mount Merapi Whakaari / White Island, has been in a continuous state of releasing volcanic gas since before European observation in 1769. Ol Doinyo Lengai Ambrym Arenal Volcano Pacaya Klyuchevskaya Sopka Sheveluch Dormant and reactivated See also: Category:Dormant volcanoes and Category:Inactive volcanoes  Narcondam Island, India, is classified as a dormant volcano by the Geological Survey of India It is difficult to distinguish an extinct volcano from a dormant (inactive) one. Dormant volcanoes are those that have not erupted for thousands of years, but are likely to erupt again in the future.[58][59] Volcanoes are often considered to be extinct if there are no written records of its activity. Nevertheless, volcanoes may remain dormant for a long period of time. For example, Yellowstone has a repose/recharge period of around 700,000 years, and Toba of around 380,000 years.[60] Vesuvius was described by Roman writers as having been covered with gardens and vineyards before its eruption of 79 CE, which destroyed the towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii. Before its catastrophic eruption of 1991, Pinatubo was an inconspicuous volcano, unknown to most people in the surrounding areas. Two other examples are the long-dormant Soufrière Hills volcano on the island of Montserrat, thought to be extinct before activity resumed in 1995, and Fourpeaked Mountain in Alaska, which, before its September 2006 eruption, had not erupted since before 8000 BCE and had long been thought to be extinct.  Extinct ""Extinct volcano"" redirects here. For the category of extinct volcanoes, see Category:Extinct volcanoes.  Fourpeaked volcano, Alaska, in September 2006 after being thought extinct for over 10,000 years  Mount Rinjani eruption in 1994, in Lombok, Indonesia Extinct volcanoes are those that scientists consider unlikely to erupt again because the volcano no longer has a magma supply. Examples of extinct volcanoes are many volcanoes on the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain in the Pacific Ocean (although some volcanoes at the eastern end of the chain are active), Hohentwiel in Germany, Shiprock in New Mexico, Zuidwal volcano in the Netherlands and many volcanoes in Italy like Monte Vulture. Edinburgh Castle in Scotland is located atop an extinct volcano. Whether a volcano is truly extinct is often difficult to determine. Since ""supervolcano"" calderas can have eruptive lifespans sometimes measured in millions of years, a caldera that has not produced an eruption in tens of thousands of years may be considered dormant instead of extinct. Some volcanologists refer to extinct volcanoes as inactive, though the term is now more commonly used for dormant volcanoes once thought to be extinct.[citation needed]  Volcanic-alert level The three common popular classifications of volcanoes can be subjective and some volcanoes thought to have been extinct have erupted again. To help prevent people from falsely believing they are not at risk when living on or near a volcano, countries have adopted new classifications to describe the various levels and stages of volcanic activity.[61] Some alert systems use different numbers or colors to designate the different stages. Other systems use colors and words. Some systems use a combination of both.  Volcano warning schemes of the United States Main article: Volcano warning schemes of the United States The United States Geological Survey (USGS) has adopted a common system nationwide for characterizing the level of unrest and eruptive activity at volcanoes. The new volcano alert-level system classifies volcanoes now as being in a normal, advisory, watch or warning stage. Additionally, colors are used to denote the amount of ash produced.  Decade volcanoes  Koryaksky volcano towering over Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on Kamchatka Peninsula, Far Eastern Russia Main articles: Lists of volcanoes and Decade Volcanoes The Decade Volcanoes are 16 volcanoes identified by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth''s Interior (IAVCEI) as being worthy of particular study in light of their history of large, destructive eruptions and proximity to populated areas. They are named Decade Volcanoes because the project was initiated as part of the United Nations-sponsored International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (the 1990s). The 16 current Decade Volcanoes are  Avachinsky-Koryaksky (grouped together), Kamchatka, Russia Nevado de Colima, Jalisco and Colima, Mexico Mount Etna, Sicily, Italy Galeras, Nariño, Colombia Mauna Loa, Hawaii, US Mount Merapi, Central Java, Indonesia Mount Nyiragongo, Democratic Republic of the Congo Mount Rainier, Washington, US Sakurajima, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan Santa Maria/Santiaguito, Guatemala Santorini, Cyclades, Greece Taal Volcano, Luzon, Philippines Teide, Canary Islands, Spain Ulawun, New Britain, Papua New Guinea Mount Unzen, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan Vesuvius, Naples, Italy The Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project, an initiative of the Deep Carbon Observatory, monitors nine volcanoes, two of which are Decade volcanoes. The focus of the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project is to use Multi-Component Gas Analyzer System instruments to measure CO2/SO2 ratios in real-time and in high-resolution to allow detection of the pre-eruptive degassing of rising magmas, improving prediction of volcanic activity.[62]  Volcanoes and humans  Schematic of volcano injection of aerosols and gases  Solar radiation graph 1958–2008, showing how the radiation is reduced after major volcanic eruptions  Sulfur dioxide concentration over the Sierra Negra Volcano, Galapagos Islands, during an eruption in October 2005 Volcanic eruptions pose a significant threat to human civilization. However, volcanic activity has also provided humans with important resources.  Hazards Main article: Volcanic hazards There are many different types of volcanic eruptions and associated activity: phreatic eruptions (steam-generated eruptions), explosive eruption of high-silica lava (e.g., rhyolite), effusive eruption of low-silica lava (e.g., basalt), pyroclastic flows, lahars (debris flow) and carbon dioxide emission. All of these activities can pose a hazard to humans. Earthquakes, hot springs, fumaroles, mud pots and geysers often accompany volcanic activity.  Volcanic gases can reach the stratosphere, where they form sulfuric acid aerosols that can reflect solar radiation and lower surface temperatures significantly.[63] Sulfur dioxide from the eruption of Huaynaputina probably caused the Russian famine of 1601–1603.[64] Chemical reactions of sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere can also damage the ozone layer, and acids such as hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF) can fall to the ground as acid rain. Explosive volcanic eruptions release the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide and thus provide a deep source of carbon for biogeochemical cycles.[65]  Ash thrown into the air by eruptions can present a hazard to aircraft, especially jet aircraft where the particles can be melted by the high operating temperature; the melted particles then adhere to the turbine blades and alter their shape, disrupting the operation of the turbine. This can cause major disruptions to air travel.   Comparison of major United States supereruptions (VEI 7 and 8) with major historical volcanic eruptions in the 19th and 20th century. From left to right: Yellowstone 2.1 Ma, Yellowstone 1.3 Ma, Long Valley 6.26 Ma, Yellowstone 0.64 Ma . 19th century eruptions: Tambora 1815, Krakatoa 1883. 20th century eruptions: Novarupta 1912, St. Helens 1980, Pinatubo 1991. A volcanic winter is thought to have taken place around 70,000 years ago after the supereruption of Lake Toba on Sumatra island in Indonesia,[66] This may have created a population bottleneck that affected the genetic inheritance of all humans today.[67] Volcanic eruptions may have contributed to major extinction events, such as the End-Ordovician, Permian-Triassic, and Late Devonian mass extinctions.[68]  The 1815 eruption of Mount Tambora created global climate anomalies that became known as the ""Year Without a Summer"" because of the effect on North American and European weather.[69] The freezing winter of 1740–41, which led to widespread famine in northern Europe, may also owe its origins to a volcanic eruption.[70]  Benefits See also: Volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposit and Geothermal power Although volcanic eruptions pose considerable hazards to humans, past volcanic activity has created important economic resources.  Volcanic ash and weathered basalt produce some of the most fertile soil in the world, rich in nutrients such as iron, magnesium, potassium, calcium, and phosphorus.[71]  Tuff formed from volcanic ash is a relatively soft rock, and it has been used for construction since ancient times.[72][73] The Romans often used tuff, which is abundant in Italy, for construction.[74] The Rapa Nui people used tuff to make most of the moai statues in Easter Island.[75]  Volcanic activity is responsible for emplacing valuable mineral resources, such as metal ores.[71]  Volcanic activity is accompanied by high rates of heat flow from the Earth''s interior. These can be tapped as geothermal power.[71]  Volcanoes on other celestial bodies See also: List of extraterrestrial volcanoes, Geology of the Moon, Volcanology of Mars, Volcanology of Io, and Volcanology of Venus  The Tvashtar volcano erupts a plume 330 km (205 mi) above the surface of Jupiter''s moon Io. The Earth''s Moon has no large volcanoes and no current volcanic activity, although recent evidence suggests it may still possess a partially molten core.[76] However, the Moon does have many volcanic features such as maria (the darker patches seen on the moon), rilles and domes.  The planet Venus has a surface that is 90% basalt, indicating that volcanism played a major role in shaping its surface. The planet may have had a major global resurfacing event about 500 million years ago,[77] from what scientists can tell from the density of impact craters on the surface. Lava flows are widespread and forms of volcanism not present on Earth occur as well. Changes in the planet''s atmosphere and observations of lightning have been attributed to ongoing volcanic eruptions, although there is no confirmation of whether or not Venus is still volcanically active. However, radar sounding by the Magellan probe revealed evidence for comparatively recent volcanic activity at Venus''s highest volcano Maat Mons, in the form of ash flows near the summit and on the northern flank.   Olympus Mons (Latin, ""Mount Olympus""), located on the planet Mars, is the tallest known mountain in the Solar System. There are several extinct volcanoes on Mars, four of which are vast shield volcanoes far bigger than any on Earth. They include Arsia Mons, Ascraeus Mons, Hecates Tholus, Olympus Mons, and Pavonis Mons. These volcanoes have been extinct for many millions of years,[78] but the European Mars Express spacecraft has found evidence that volcanic activity may have occurred on Mars in the recent past as well.[78]  Jupiter''s moon Io is the most volcanically active object in the solar system because of tidal interaction with Jupiter. It is covered with volcanoes that erupt sulfur, sulfur dioxide and silicate rock, and as a result, Io is constantly being resurfaced. Its lavas are the hottest known anywhere in the solar system, with temperatures exceeding 1,800 K (1,500 °C). In February 2001, the largest recorded volcanic eruptions in the solar system occurred on Io.[79] Europa, the smallest of Jupiter''s Galilean moons, also appears to have an active volcanic system, except that its volcanic activity is entirely in the form of water, which freezes into ice on the frigid surface. This process is known as cryovolcanism, and is apparently most common on the moons of the outer planets of the solar system.  In 1989, the Voyager 2 spacecraft observed cryovolcanoes (ice volcanoes) on Triton, a moon of Neptune, and in 2005 the Cassini–Huygens probe photographed fountains of frozen particles erupting from Enceladus, a moon of Saturn.[80][81] The ejecta may be composed of water, liquid nitrogen, ammonia, dust, or methane compounds. Cassini–Huygens also found evidence of a methane-spewing cryovolcano on the Saturnian moon Titan, which is believed to be a significant source of the methane found in its atmosphere.[82] It is theorized that cryovolcanism may also be present on the Kuiper Belt Object Quaoar.  A 2010 study of the exoplanet COROT-7b, which was detected by transit in 2009, suggested that tidal heating from the host star very close to the planet and neighboring planets could generate intense volcanic activity similar to that found on Io.[83]  History of volcanology Main article: History of volcanology Many ancient accounts ascribe volcanic eruptions to supernatural causes, such as the actions of gods or demigods. To the ancient Greeks, volcanoes'' capricious power could only be explained as acts of the gods, while 16th/17th-century German astronomer Johannes Kepler believed they were ducts for the Earth''s tears.[84] One early idea counter to this was proposed by Jesuit Athanasius Kircher (1602–1680), who witnessed eruptions of Mount Etna and Stromboli, then visited the crater of Vesuvius and published his view of an Earth with a central fire connected to numerous others caused by the burning of sulfur, bitumen and coal.  Various explanations were proposed for volcano behavior before the modern understanding of the Earth''s mantle structure as a semisolid material was developed. For decades after awareness that compression and radioactive materials may be heat sources, their contributions were specifically discounted. Volcanic action was often attributed to chemical reactions and a thin layer of molten rock near the surface.  olcanology (also spelled vulcanology) is the study of volcanoes, lava, magma and related geological, geophysical and geochemical phenomena (volcanism).   The term volcanology is derived from the Latin word vulcan.  Vulcan was the ancient Roman god of fire.A volcanologist is a geologist who studies the eruptive activity and formation of volcanoes and their current and historic eruptions. Volcanologists frequently visit volcanoes, especially active ones, to observe volcanic eruptions, collect eruptive products including tephra (such as ash or pumice), rock and lava samples. One major focus of enquiry is the prediction of eruptions; there is currently no accurate way to do this, but predicting eruptions, like predicting earthquakes, could save many lives. Modern volcanology In 1841, the first volcanological observatory, the Vesuvius Observatory, was founded in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.Seismic observations are made using seismographs deployed near volcanic areas, watching out for increased seismicity during volcanic events, in particular looking for long period harmonic tremors, which signal magma movement through volcanic conduits.Surface deformation monitoring includes the use of geodetic techniques such as leveling, tilt, strain, angle and distance measurements through tiltmeters, total stations and EDMs. This also includes GNSS observations and InSAR. Surface deformation indicates magma upwelling: increased magma supply produces bulges in the volcanic center''s surface.Gas emissions may be monitored with equipment including portable ultra-violet spectrometers (COSPEC, now superseded by the miniDOAS), which analyzes the presence of volcanic gases such as sulfur dioxide; or by infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR). Increased gas emissions, and more particularly changes in gas compositions, may signal an impending volcanic eruption.Temperature changes are monitored using thermometers and observing changes in thermal properties of volcanic lakes and vents, which may indicate  upcoming activity.Satellites are widely used to monitor volcanoes, as they allow a large area to be monitored easily.  They can measure the spread of an ash plume, such as the one from Eyjafjallajökull''s 2010 eruption, as well as SO2 emissions.  InSAR and thermal imaging can monitor large, scarcely populated areas where it would be too expensive to maintain instruments on the ground.Other geophysical techniques (electrical, gravity and magnetic observations) include monitoring fluctuations and sudden change in resistivity, gravity anomalies or magnetic anomaly patterns that may indicate volcano-induced faulting and magma upwelling.Stratigraphic analyses includes analyzing tephra and lava deposits and dating these to give volcano eruption patterns, with estimated cycles of intense activity and size of eruptions. History Volcanology has an extensive history. The earliest known recording of a volcanic eruption may be on a wall painting dated to about 7,000 BCE found at the Neolithic site at Çatal Höyük in Anatolia, Turkey. This painting has been interpreted as a depiction of an erupting volcano, with a cluster of houses below shows a twin peaked volcano in eruption, with a town at its base (though archaeologists now question this interpretation). The volcano may be either Hasan Dağ, or its smaller neighbour, Melendiz Dağ.= Greco-Roman philosophy =The classical world of Greece and the early Roman Empire explained volcanoes as sites of various gods. Greeks considered that Hephaestus, the god of fire, sat below the volcano Etna, forging the weapons of Zeus. The Greek word used to describe volcanoes was etna, or hiera, after Heracles, the son of Zeus. The Roman poet Virgil, in interpreting the Greek mythos, held that the giant  Enceladus was buried beneath Etna by the goddess Athena as punishment for rebellion against the gods; the mountain''s rumblings were his tormented cries, the flames his breath and the tremors his railing against the bars of his prison. Enceladus'' brother Mimas was buried beneath Vesuvius by Hephaestus, and the blood of other defeated giants welled up in the Phlegrean Fields surrounding Vesuvius.The Greek philosopher Empedocles (c. 490-430 BCE) saw the world divided into four elemental forces, of Earth, Air, Fire and Water. Volcanoes, Empedocles maintained, were the manifestation of Elemental Fire.  Plato contended that channels of hot and cold waters flow in inexhaustible quantities through subterranean rivers. In the depths of the earth snakes a vast river of fire, the Pyriphlegethon, which feeds all the world''s volcanoes. Aristotle considered underground fire as the result of ""the...friction of the wind when it plunges into narrow passages.""Wind played a key role in volcano explanations until the 16th century. Lucretius, a Roman philosopher, claimed Etna was completely hollow and the fires of the underground driven by a fierce wind circulating near sea level. Ovid believed that the flame was fed from ""fatty foods"" and eruptions stopped when the food ran out. Vitruvius contended that sulfur, alum and bitumen fed the deep fires. Observations by Pliny the Elder noted the presence of earthquakes preceded an eruption; he died in the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE while investigating it at Stabiae. His nephew, Pliny the Younger, gave detailed descriptions of the eruption in which his uncle died, attributing his death to the effects of toxic gases. Such eruptions have been named Plinian in honour of the two authors.= Renaissance observations =Nuées ardentes were described from the Azores in 1580. Georgius Agricola argued the rays of the sun, as later proposed by Descartes had nothing to do with volcanoes. Agricola believed vapor under pressure caused eruptions of ''mointain oil'' and basalt.Jesuit Athanasius Kircher (1602–1680) witnessed eruptions of Mount Etna and Stromboli, then visited the crater of Vesuvius and published his view of an Earth with a central fire connected to numerous others caused by the burning of sulfur, bitumen and coal.Johannes Kepler considered volcanoes as conduits for the tears and excrement of the Earth, voiding bitumen, tar and sulfur. Descartes, pronouncing that God had created the Earth in an instant, declared he had done so in three layers; the fiery depths, a layer of water, and the air. Volcanoes, he said, were formed where the rays of the sun pierced the earth.Science wrestled with the ideas of the combustion of pyrite with water, that rock was solidified bitumen, and with notions of rock being formed from water (Neptunism). Of the volcanoes then known, all were near the water, hence the action of the sea upon the land was used to explain volcanism.= Interaction with religion and mythology =Tribal legends of volcanoes abound from the Pacific Ring of Fire and the Americas, usually invoking the forces of the supernatural or the divine to explain the violent outbursts of volcanoes. Taranaki and Tongariro, according to Māori mythology, were lovers who fell in love with Pihanga, and a spiteful jealous fight ensued. Māori will not to this day live between Tongariro and Taranaki for fear of the dispute flaring up again.In the Hawaiian religion, Pele ( Pel-a; [ˈpɛlɛ]) is the goddess of volcanoes and a popular figure in Hawaiian mythology. Pele was used for various scientific terms as for Pele''s hair, Pele''s tears, and Limu o Pele (Pele''s seaweed). A volcano on the Jovian moon Io is also named Pele.Saint Agatha is patron saint of Catania, close to mount Etna, and an important highly venerated (till today) example of virgin martyrs of Christian antiquity. In 253 CE, one year after her violent death, the stilling of an eruption of Mt. Etna was attributed to her intercession. Catania was however nearly completely destroyed by the eruption of Mt. Etna in 1169, and over 15,000 of its inhabitants died. Nevertheless, she was invoked again for the 1669 Etna eruption and, for an outbreak danginering Nicolosi in 1886. The way she is invoked and dealt with in Italian Folk religion, a sort of quid pro quo way approach to saints, has been related (in the tradition of James Frazer) to earlier pagan believes.In 1660 the eruption of Vesuvius rained twinned pyroxene crystals and ash upon the nearby villages. The crystals resembled the crucifix and this was interpreted as the work of Saint Januarius. In Naples, the relics of St Januarius are paraded through town at every major eruption of Vesuvius. The register of these processions and the 1779 and 1794 diary of Father Antonio Piaggio allowed British diplomat and amateur naturalist Sir William Hamilton to provide a detailed chronology and description of Vesuvius'' eruptions.

Retrieved   Volcanism (or volcanicity) is the phenomenon of eruption of molten rock (magma) onto the surface of the Earth or a solid-surface planet or moon, where lava, pyroclastics and volcanic gases erupt through a break in the surface called a vent. It includes all phenomena resulting from and causing magma within the crust or mantle of the body, to rise through the crust and form volcanic rocks on the surface. Volcanic processes Magma from the mantle or lower crust rises through its crust towards the surface. If magma reaches the surface, its behavior depends on the viscosity of the molten constituent rock. Viscous (thick) magma produces volcanoes characterised by explosive eruptions, while non-viscous (runny) magma produce volcanoes characterised by effusive eruptions pouring large amounts of lava onto the surface.In some cases, rising magma can cool and solidify without reaching the surface. Instead, the cooled and solidified igneous mass crystallises within the crust to form an igneous intrusion. As magma cools the chemicals in the crystals formed are effectively removed from the main mix of the magma (by a process known as fractional crystallization), so the chemical content of the remaining magma evolves as it solidifies slowly. Fresh unevolved magma injections can remobilise more evolved magmas, allowing eruptions from more viscous magmas. Driving forces of volcanism Movement of molten rock in the mantle, caused by thermal convection currents, coupled with gravitational effects of changes on the earth''s surface (erosion, deposition, even asteroid impact and patterns of post-glacial rebound) drive plate tectonic motion and ultimately volcanism. Aspects of volcanism = Volcanoes =Volcanoes are places where magma reaches the planet''s surface.The type of volcano depends on the location of the eruption and the consistency of the magma.= Intrusions =These are formed where magma pushes between existing rock, intrusions can be in the form of batholiths, dikes, sills and layered intrusions.= Earthquakes =Earthquakes are generally associated with plate tectonic activity, but some earthquakes are generated as a result of volcanic activity (though that itself is ultimately driven by the same forces).= Hydrothermal vents =These are formed where water interacts with volcanism.These include geysers, fumaroles, hotsprings and mudpots, they are often used as a source of geothermal energy.= Volcanic winter =The amount of gas and ash emitted by volcanic eruptions has a significant effect on the Earth''s climate. Large eruptions correlate well with some significant climate change events. Forming rocks When magma cools it solidifies and forms rocks. The type of rock formed depends on the chemical composition of the magma and how rapidly it cools. Magma that reaches the surface to become lava cools rapidly, resulting in rocks with small crystals such as basalt. Some of this magma may cool extremely rapidly and will form volcanic glass (rocks without crystals) such as obsidian. Magma trapped below ground in thin intrusions cools more slowly than exposed magma and produces rocks with medium-sized crystals. Magma that remains trapped in large quantities below ground cools most slowly resulting in rocks with larger crystals, such as granite and gabbro.Existing rocks that come into contact with magma may be melted and assimilated into the magma. Other rocks adjacent to the magma may be altered by contact metamorphism or metasomatism as they are affected by the heat and escaping or externally-circulating hydrothermal fluids. Volcanism on other bodies Volcanism is not confined only to Earth, but is thought to be found on any body having a solid crust and fluid mantle. Evidence of volcanism should still be found on any body that has had volcanism at some point in its history. Volcanoes have indeed been clearly observed on other bodies in the Solar System – on some, such as Mars, in the shape of mountains that are unmistakably old volcanoes (most notably Olympus Mons), but on Io actual ongoing eruptions have been observed. It can be surmised that volcanism exists on planets and moons of this type in other planetary systems as well. In 2014, scientists found 70 lava flows which formed on the Moon in the last 100 million years.

Such an established event provides a ""tephra horizon"". The premise of the technique is that each volcanic event produces ash with a unique chemical ""fingerprint"" that allows the deposit to be identified across the area affected by fallout. Thus, once the volcanic event has been independently dated, the tephra horizon will act as time marker.The main advantages of the technique are that the volcanic ash layers can be relatively easily identified in many sediments and that the tephra layers are deposited relatively instantaneously over a wide spatial area. This means they provide accurate temporal marker layers which can be used to verify or corroborate other dating techniques, linking sequences widely separated by location into a unified chronology that correlates climatic sequences and events.Tephrochronology requires accurate geochemical fingerprinting (usually via an electron microprobe). An important recent advance is the use of LA-ICP-MS (i.e. laser ablation ICP-MS) to measure trace-element abundances in individual tephra shards. One problem in tephrochronology is that tephra chemistry can become altered over time, at least for basaltic tephras.Early tephra horizons were identified with the Saksunarvatn tephra (Icelandic origin, c. 10.2 cal. ka BP), forming a horizon in the late Pre-Boreal of Northern Europe, the Vedde ash (also Icelandic in origin, c. 12.0 cal. ka BP) and the Laacher See tephra (in the Eifel volcanic field, c. 12.9 cal. ka BP). Major volcanoes which have been used in tephrochronological studies include Vesuvius, Hekla and Santorini. Minor volcanic events may also leave their fingerprint in the geological record: Hayes Volcano is responsible for a series of six major tephra layers in the Cook Inlet region of Alaska. Tephra horizons provide a synchronous check against which to correlate the palaeoclimatic reconstructions that are obtained from terrestrial records, like fossil pollen studies (palynology), from varves in lake sediments or from marine deposits and ice-core records, and to extend the limits of carbon-14 dating.A pioneer in the use of tephra layers as marker horizons to establish chronology was Sigurdur Thorarinsson, who began by studying the layers he found in his native Iceland. Since the late 1990s, techniques developed by Chris S. M. Turney (QUB, Belfast; now University of Exeter) and others for extracting tephra horizons invisible to the naked eye (""cryptotephra"") have revolutionised the application of tephrochronology. This technique relies upon the difference between the specific gravity of the microtephra shards and the host sediment matrix. It has led to the first discovery of the Vedde ash on the mainland of Britain, in Sweden, in the Netherlands, in the Swiss Lake Soppensee and in two sites on the Karelian Isthmus of Baltic Russia.It has also revealed previously undetected ash layers, such as the Borrobol Tephra first discovered in northern Scotland, dated to c. 14.4 cal. ka BP, the microtephra horizons of equivalent geochemistry from southern Sweden, dated at 13,900 Cariaco varve yrs BP and from northwest Scotland, dated at 13.6 cal. ka BP.

Stefan Wastegård et al., ""Towards a tephrochronology framework for the last glacial/interglacial transition in Scandinavia and the Faroe Islands""  Dr. Kiyoo Mogi, Mogi Kiyoo, born 1929 in Yamagata Prefecture, Japan) is a prominent seismologist. He is regarded as Japan''s foremost authority on earthquake prediction and is a former chair of the Japanese Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction (CCEP). Mogi is also a former Director of the University of Tokyo''s Earthquake Research Institute, was a professor at Nihon University and is professor emeritus at Tokyo University. Due to the seismic activity in Japan, Mogi has also taken an interest in safety of nuclear power in Japan.In 1969 Mogi predicted that there was a possibility of a shallow magnitude 8.0 earthquake in the Tōkai region of Japan, an area that has experienced a number of previous large earthquakes. Following the passing of the Large-Scale Earthquake Countermeasure Act, in 1978 Mogi was appointed to the newly created Earthquake Assessment Committee (EAC) for the expected Tokai earthquake, charged with warning the government if the quake was imminent. He went on to chair the ECA from 1991 until he resigned the post in 1996 after failing to persuade the government of the need to take uncertainty into account when issuing warnings. Nuclear power Following damage at the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant due to the 2007 Chūetsu offshore earthquake, Mogi called for the immediate closure of the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant, which was built close to the centre of the expected Tōkai earthquake despite his 1969 prediction. Previously, in 2004, he had stated that the issue ''is a critical problem which can bring a catastrophe to Japan through a man-made disaster''. Mogi doughnut hypothesis In 1969 Mogi proposed a hypothesis for earthquake prediction, now known as the ''Mogi doughnut hypothesis'', that major earthquakes tend to occur in an unusually seismically calm area surrounded by a ring of unusually high seismic activity. The Mogi doughnut is one of several pattern hypotheses that have been proposed. Mogi model In 1958 Mogi was responsible for a major advance in understanding the dynamics of volcanos. After studying data from several sources, he concluded that a mathematical solution developed by Yamakawa in 1955 could be used in the modelling of the deformation of a volcano caused by pressure changes in its magma chamber. The ''Mogi model'' (also known as the ''Mogi-Yamakawa model'') subsequently became the first commonly used quantitative method in volcanology, and is still widely used today.
